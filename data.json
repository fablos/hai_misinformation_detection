                    "body": "The United Nations nuclear agency chief says his experts are staying put after they cross into Russian-held territory in Ukraine and reach Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, where both sides warn of potential catastrophe.\nAn International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team braved intense shelling to reach the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, arriving after a delay of several hours on Thursday in a large convoy with a heavy presence of Russian soldiers nearby.\n“We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving. It’s going to stay there,” IAEA head Rafael Grossi, who personally led the mission, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory.\nHe said a group of IAEA experts had stayed behind at the plant and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation.\n“I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable,” he said.\nAl Jazeera’s Teresa Bo, reporting from Kyiv, said the IAEA team was looking to evaluate the level of damage at the site and the conditions of the Ukrainian personnel.\n“A few days ago there were reports that several shells fell very close to where the nuclear reactors are located. This is a major concern and they will have to evaluate what is going on on the ground,” she said.\nUkraine and Russia accuse each other of creating a risk of a Chernobyl-like disaster by shelling near the plant, where the situation has been unravelling in recent weeks. Russia seized the plant early in the now more than six-month-old war.\nKyiv also accuses Russia of using the facility to shield its forces and of planning to steal its output by hooking it up to the Russian power grid. Moscow denies this but has so far rejected international calls to withdraw its troops from the plant.\nVideo footage released by Russia’s state news agency RIA showed IAEA inspectors, including Grossi, wearing safety helmets and being shown around the site by Russian energy officials, who pointed out what were described as damaged water pipes.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow was doing everything to ensure that the plant could operate safely, and for the IAEA inspectors to be able to complete their tasks.\nEarlier, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said Russian shelling had forced the shutdown of one of the two reactors still operating at the site.\nAs the inspectors arrived at the front line, Russian and Russian-installed local officials accused Kyiv of sending troops on boats near dawn to try to capture the plant on Thursday, and of shelling the nearby Russian-held city of Enerhodar.\nKyiv accused the Russians of staging those incidents to blame Ukraine and block the IAEA visit.\nSince its capture by Russia in March, the plant has been controlled by Russian troops but operated by Ukrainian staff.\nThe plant sits on the south bank of a huge reservoir on the Dnieper River that divides Russian and Ukrainian forces in central southern Ukraine. Before the war, it supplied more than a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity.\nBoth sides have claimed battlefield successes in the new Ukrainian push to recapture territory in the south, although details have been scarce so far, with Ukrainian officials releasing little information about their advance.\nMillions of people have fled Ukraine, thousands have been killed, and cities have been reduced to rubble in what Kyiv and the West call Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression.\nMoscow calls its actions a “special military operation” to rid Ukraine of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities.",

                    "title": "What happens if Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant explodes?",
                    "body": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has raised the alarm about shelling around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it could lead to a “nuclear disaster”.\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of attacking the plant and of “nuclear terrorism”. The IAEA has urged “utmost restraint” and called on both sides to demilitarise the area.\nHere’s what we know:\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and among the 10 biggest in the world. It generates half of Ukraine’s nuclear-derived power.\nThe plant has a total capacity of about 6,000 megawatts, enough for about four million homes.\nIt is located in the southern Ukrainian steppe on the Dnieper River, some 550km (342 miles) southeast of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and about 525km (325 miles) south of Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident in 1986.\nCurrently, the plant is operated by Ukrainian staff, but Russian military units guard the facility.\nAccording to the IAEA, the plant has six Soviet-designed water-cooled reactors containing uranium 235, each of which has a net capacity of 950 megawatts. A megawatt of capacity will provide energy for 400 to 900 homes in a year.\nThe plant is located about 200km (125 miles) from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\n\nThe UN’s nuclear watchdog issued a report on the plant on September 6, saying it was “gravely concerned about the situation”.\nIt called for measures to prevent an accident, including the establishment of a “nuclear safety and security protection zone”. It also said the plant has been damaged near the reactor buildings.\nWhile shelling has not triggered a nuclear emergency, the watchdog reported the situation “represents a threat to nuclear safety”.\nLast month, Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the IAEA, said that “every principle of nuclear safety has been violated.”\nAccording to experts, it is possible but the likelihood of that taking place is unclear.\n“What we have here with the military involvement is very difficult … If multiple catastrophic factors come together, an explosion might be possible,” Ross Peel, the research and knowledge transfer manager for the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera recently.\n“It’s difficult to say whether this will [happen] and the possible consequences of that, what they might be. It depends how the explosion comes about,” said Peel.\nThere are concerns about the shelling occurring around the facility, with the potential to damage critical infrastructure, including the reactors.\n“Reactors [need] to be constantly cooled by water passing through [them,]” MV Ramana, a professor at the University of British Columbia’s School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera.\n“If that water stream is cut out, cut down, cut off in some fashion, then the reactor could lose cooling, the fuel will start melting. It will sort of create high pressure, and the thing can explode,” he added\nIn the immediate aftermath of an explosion, experts said the likely result would be widespread evacuations to escape an invisible radioactive cloud. However, the effect of a leak in radiation would probably be felt for years to come.\n“You’re probably going to see hundreds of thousands of people trying to flee from that area,” Ramana told Al Jazeera.\n“There will be a cloud, but you’re not going to be able to see it … We’re able to track the cloud because [we] have sensitive instruments that are measuring radiation levels.”\nSome of the illnesses could be acute radiation poisoning or cancers that emerge later.\n“So, for instance, at Chernobyl, the people who were going into the reactor to actually stand on top of the burning building and put the fire out were exposed to huge amounts of radiation and suffered the impacts of that within hours,” Peel said.\n“People who are exposed to not quite so great amounts may still suffer from acute radiation poisoning and recover. This happens over days to weeks, maybe months. For people exposed to lower levels of radiation, there may be greater numbers of cancer cases coming later over the following years to decades,” he added.\nRather than a reactor core explosion, experts are more concerned about damage to systems that cool the spent fuel pool and the reactors. If the cooling fails, this could lead to an uncontrolled heat buildup, a meltdown and a fire that could release and spread radiation from the containment structures.\n“We’re mostly scared of radiation release, not necessarily of an explosion,” Amelie Stoetzel, a PhD Student in the Department of War Studies at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera.\n“Even though that looks scary, [a] radiation release, in any case, would be catastrophic,” she added.\n“It’s unpredictable; we don’t really know where the plume [containing radioactive material] would go; it can go anywhere really, depending on the weather conditions,” Stoetzel continued.\nDue to the plant’s geographic location, a radiation release could hit any part of the European continent.\n“Zaporizhzhia is in the middle of the continent. So no matter which way the wind is blowing, somebody’s going to get contaminated,” Ramana said.\nOverall, experts emphasised that any kind of prediction is hard to make at this stage.\n“The only certainty we have really is that the military activity around the nuclear power plant poses a risk to it. And how exactly that will play out is, is very difficult to predict,” Peel said.\nExperts expected immediate evacuations but also difficulties in accessing medical facilities since they would probably see a surge in patients.\n“When there were incidents of radiation accidents, there were a lot of people that showed up with symptoms of radiation poisoning, even though they had not been exposed, due to fear and panic,” Stoetzel said.\nExperts also said that evacuations in a war zone will come with their own set of complications.\n“A lot of people have already left the area, but there are still a lot of people left behind,” Stoetzel said.\n“So yes, there would be a lot of people rushing to hospitals and rushing to get out of the area, which would be a problem … there would be confusion; in an ongoing war, evacuating people is extremely difficult,” she added.\nAccording to experts, for many people, the fear of radiation could be more dangerous than the radiation itself.\n“We could see an uptick in patients because of the psychological symptoms that are connected to the knowledge that radiation might have leaked from a nuclear power plant nearby,”\n“So actually, the most problematic issue for the government at least would be how to deal with a large number of patients,” she added.\nIn case of an explosion, or a fire, a leak of radiation could lead to a “long-term disaster”.\n“It’s not something where people are going to be exposed to it and immediately fall down and die … there’s going to be a huge, psychological toll, right on top of the psychological toll of the war itself,” Ramana said.",

This is very expensive and what we’re seeing now is the costs starting to spill over,” he told Al Jazeera.\nFinland and Sweden on Sunday also announced plans to offer billions of dollars in liquidity guarantees to energy companies in their countries after Russia’s Gazprom shut the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, deepening Europe’s energy crisis.\nFinland is aiming to offer $10bn and Sweden plans to offer $23.2bn (250 billion Swedish crowns) in liquidity guarantees.\n“The government’s programme is a last-resort financing option for companies that would otherwise be threatened with insolvency,” Finland Prime Minister Sanna Marin said at a news conference.\nMeanwhile, UK Conservative leadership hopeful Liz Truss has announced she intends to outline her vision on how to deal with rising energy costs within a week if she becomes prime minister on Tuesday.\nThe United Kingdom has a price cap on the most widely used household energy contracts but energy bills will jump 80 percent, to an average of 3,549 pounds ($4,188) a year from October, regulator Ofgem said, calling it a “crisis” that needed to be tackled by urgent and decisive government intervention.",

                    "body": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for the establishment of a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia and the site of recent shelling.\n“The current situation is untenable,” the United Nations atomic watchdog said in a report on Tuesday after it sent a team to the plant last week.\nThe occupation of the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, has sparked fears of a nuclear disaster as both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war trade blame for shelling the site.\n“There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA said.\n“This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone,” it said in its report.\n“The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities,” it said.\nIAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi, who led the inspection visit, briefed the UN Security Council on the agency’s findings on Tuesday.\nBefore Grossi’s presentation, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanded that Russian and Ukrainian forces commit to halting all military activity around the plant and agree on a “demilitarised perimeter.”\nGuterres said this would include “a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it.”\nHe warned that damage to the plant, whether intentional or not, “could spell catastrophe” in the region and beyond.\n\nRussian troops seized control of the site in early March and there have been repeated attacks in the vicinity. Both Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility.\nThe IAEA said on Saturday that the plant had been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line.\nThe long-awaited report did not ascribe blame for damage at the plant. Inspectors said they had found Russian troops and equipment at the plant, including military vehicles parked in turbine halls. They also said conditions for the plant’s Ukrainian staff should be improved to reduce the likelihood of errors.\n“Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian military occupation are under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available,” the IAEA report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety.”\nNajmedin Meskati, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California and who has worked on nuclear safety for 35 years, told Al Jazeera the report’s findings on the mental health of the staff were “very scary”.\nReading out from the report and highlighting comments such as “unbelievable pressure” and “friction in decision making” when dealing with Russian troops, he said: “These are all, unfortunately, a recipe for disaster.”\nAddressing the UN Security Council after Grossi’s presentation, Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said, “We regret that in your report … the source of the shelling is not directly named.”\n“We do understand your position as an international regulator, but in the current situation, it’s very important to call things by their name,” he said.\nShelling continued around the site on Tuesday, a day after it was again knocked off Ukraine’s electrical grid and put in the precarious position of relying on its own power to run its safety systems.\nRussian-installed officials accused Ukrainian forces of shelling Enerhodar, the city where the plant is situated, while the Ukrainians said Kremlin forces attacked the city of Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the power station.\nThe Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, reported that a powerful blast struck the city of 53,000 at about midday. The explosion left Enerhodar cut off from its power and water supplies. It was not immediately clear what caused the blast.\nWorld leaders have called for the demilitarisation of the plant, which is being run by Ukrainian engineers.\nTwo inspectors from the IAEA mission remained at the plant, a decision welcomed by Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.\n“There are Russian troops now who don’t understand what’s happening, don’t assess the risks correctly,” Podolyak said. “There is a number of our workers there, who need some kind of protection, people from the international community standing by their side and telling [Russian troops]: ‘Don’t touch these people, let them work.’”\nOn Monday, the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities reported that the plant’s last transmission line linking it to the nation’s power grid was disconnected to allow workers to put out a fire caused by shelling.\nUkrainian energy minister Herman Halushchenko told Ukrainian television, “Any repairs are impossible at this point – there are ongoing hostilities around the plant.”\nIn the meantime, the plant’s only remaining operational reactor will “generate the power the plant needs for its safety and other functions”, the IAEA said. The plant normally relies on outside power to run the critical cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel and avoid a meltdown.\nExperts say the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are designed to withstand natural disasters and even plane crashes, but the unpredictable fighting has repeatedly threatened to disrupt the cooling systems.",

The Ukrainian military posted spectacular video of explosions. Russia said the blasts were “a result of sabotage” and did not assign blame.\nCrimea borders the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces.

It said there had been no attack and no aviation equipment had been damaged.\nThe Reuters news agency cited witnesses saying they had heard at least 12 explosions around 3:20pm local time (12:20 GMT) from the base near Novofedorivka.\nUnverified videos posted on social networks showed sunbathers fleeing a nearby beach as huge clouds of smoke from the explosions rose over the horizon.\nCrimea’s health department said one civilian had been killed and a further eight people injured. The area was sealed off within a radius of five kilometres (three miles), authorities there said.\nAsked by Dozhd online television channel whether Kyiv was responsible for the attacks, Podolyak replied: “Of course not. What do we have to do with this?”\nHe added: “People who are living under occupation understand that the occupation is coming to an end.”\nZelenskyy did not directly mention the blasts in his daily video address on Tuesday but said it was right that people were focusing on Crimea.\n“We will never give it up… the Black Sea region cannot be safe while Crimea is occupied,” he said, reiterating Kyiv’s position that Crimea should be returned to Ukraine.\nIf the base was, in fact, struck by the Ukrainians, it would mark the first known major attack on a Russian military site on the Crimean Peninsula and a significant escalation of the conflict.\nThe headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol was hit by a small-scale explosion delivered by a makeshift drone last month in an attack that was blamed on Ukrainian saboteurs.\nOfficials in Moscow have long warned Ukraine that any attack on Crimea would trigger massive retaliation, including attacks on “decision-making centres” in Kyiv.\nThe Saky base has been used by Russian warplanes to attack areas in Ukraine’s south on short notice. Crimea borders the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, now occupied by Moscow.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian officials reported at least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 23 wounded by Russian shelling in 24 hours, including an attack not far from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is also not far from the Saky base.\nThe Russians fired more than 120 rockets at the town of Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the plant, Dnipropetrovsk Governor Valentyn Reznichenko said. Several apartment buildings and industrial sites were damaged, he added.\nUkraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the power station, stoking international fears of a catastrophe.\nOleksandr Starukh, the governor of the region where the plant is located, said on Tuesday that radiation levels were normal. But he warned that an accident could spread radiation with the wind, potentially carrying it to Moscow and other Russian cities.\nA Russian-installed official in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region said an air defence system at the plant would be reinforced in the aftermath of last week’s shelling.\nEvgeny Balitsky, head of the Kremlin-backed administration, told Russian state TV that power lines and other damaged portions of the plant had been restored.\nThe Ukrainians in recent weeks have been mounting counterattacks in Russian-occupied areas of southern Ukraine while trying to hold off the Kremlin’s forces in the industrial Donbas region in the east.\nHeavy fighting was also reported in front-line towns near the eastern city of Donetsk, where Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were launching waves of attacks as they tried to expand their control of the region.\nThe Ukrainian military said it had repelled ground assaults in the direction of the cities of Bakhmut and Avdiivka.\nChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said his forces had captured a factory for Moscow on the edge of the eastern town of Soledar. Other Russian-backed forces said they were in the process of “clearing out” the heavily fortified village of Pisky. Russian media reported that a group of mercenaries from the Wagner Group had dug in near the city of Bakhmut.\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the different accounts from the battlefield.\nBritish military intelligence, which is helping Ukraine, said Russia’s push towards Bakhmut had been its most successful operation in the Donbas in the last 30 days, but that it had still only managed to advance approximately 10km (six miles).",

Kherson region. Ukraine.

We feel the lack of our air forces. We need tanks and we need artillery first of all. From this perspective, I would say any sort of counteroffensive [to retake Kherson city] would be possible after receiving all of these armaments. It will take several months at least,” said Berezovets.\nRussia has launched 25 missile attacks and more than 22 air raids on military and civilian targets in Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the Ukrainian military statement added, keeping up its focus on establishing full control over the Donetsk region.\nMoscow denied any military progress by Ukrainian troops during the start of the counterattack last week, saying many of Kyiv’s soldiers were killed and wounded.\nIt was not possible for Al Jazeera to independently confirm the claims made by either side.\nRussian authorities said the situation was calm around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine after UN inspectors said it had again lost external power.\nThree strong explosions were heard in Enerhodar, the curfew-bound city where the plant is located, but there were no immediate details of damage and casualties, Russia’s official TASS news agency said on Monday.\nUkrainian troops made two attempts to deploy assault teams in the vicinity of the city, it said, adding they were using drones, heavy artillery, and rocket-launching systems.\nThe last main external power line was cut off, although a reserve line kept up the electricity supply to the grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Only one of its six reactors remained in operation, it said.\nRussian troops seized the plant shortly after President Vladimir Putin sent his army over the border on February 24. It has become a focal point of the conflict. Each side has blamed the other for shelling, which has raised fears of a nuclear disaster.\nVladimir Rogov, a pro-Russian official in the Zaporizhzhia region, told Komsomolskaya Pravda radio there had been no shelling or incursions, and IAEA experts were expected to work at the plant until at least Monday.",

Oleksandra Drik\n📺⬇️https://t.co/mhyrIpLAtk pic.twitter.com/bZe9D5E10d\n— Albania in UN (@AlMissionUN) September 7, 2022\n\nUnited States Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the meeting that estimates from a variety of sources, including the Russian government, indicate that Russian authorities have interrogated, detained and forcibly deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians.\nThomas-Greenfield said the estimates indicate thousands of children have been subject to filtration, “some separated from their families and taken from orphanages before being put up for adoption in Russia”.\nAccording to US information, “more than 1,800 children were transferred from Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine to Russia” just in July, she said.\nFiltration of Ukrainian adults allows Russia to identify Ukrainians it “deems insufficiently compliant” to Russian control, she said.\n“And there is mounting and credible evidence that those considered threatening to Russian control because of perceived pro-Ukrainian leanings are ‘disappeared’ or further detained,” she said.\nAccusing the West of trying to besmirch his country, Russian UN Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya rebuffed the allegations, calling them “unfounded”.\nNebenzya said what was labelled “filtration” was simply registering people coming to Russia.\n“As far as we can judge similar procedures are applied in Poland and other countries of the European Union against Ukrainian refugees,” he told the Security Council.\nHe said more than 3.7 million Ukrainians, including 600,000 children, have gone to Russia or Russian-controlled separatist areas in eastern Ukraine, but they “aren’t being kept in prisons”.\nAl Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said the Russian ambassador told the Security Council that the allegations made at the meeting were “a new milestone in the disinformation campaign by Western nations”.\nThe ambassador also described those who had been transferred to Russia as refugees, and his country was “providing them with every assistance”, Bays said.\nHowever, Human Rights Watch said its research has shown that “force deportation is taking place, and it says that amounts to a war crime”, Bays added.\nHuman Right Watch released a report last week on the forcible transfers of Ukrainians to Russia, a practice which the organisation described as “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”.\nUS Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council meeting that Russia’s denial of using filtration was expected, adding that the UN should be allowed to investigate the allegations.\n“Let the United Nations in,” she told the Russian ambassador and other council members.\n“Give the independent observers access. Give NGOs access. Allow humanitarian access,” she said.\nThe UN under-secretary-general for political affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, said the reports of forced transfer of Ukrainians by Russian forces “must be investigated”.\nAll wars are tragic, but none more than wars of choice. The disturbing allegations of forced displacement and abuse in \"filtration\" camps in #Ukraine must be investigated. We need peace in Ukraine, peace based on the @UN Charter and international law. https://t.co/JVE3epY1x5\n— Rosemary A. DiCarlo (@DicarloRosemary) September 7, 2022\n\n“The persistent allegations of forced displacement, deportation and so-called ‘filtration camps’ run by the Russian Federation and affiliated local forces are extremely disturbing,” she said.\nDiCarlo also called for UN access to Ukrainians living in Russian-controlled areas and reiterated that the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine “must have unimpeded access to all individuals detained in relation to the ongoing war”.\n“This includes access to places of internment of Ukrainian prisoners of war and detainees in the Russian Federation,” she said.\n“Both sides to the conflict must fully abide with their obligations under international law.”\nEarlier, the US State Department said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s office is directly managing the filtration program and the forced relocation of thousands of Ukrainians into Russia.\n“We assess that the Kremlin use filtration operations as crucial to their efforts annex areas of Ukraine under their control,” State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said.",

                    "body": "Accounts that thousands of residents of Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol have been forcibly deported to Russia are “disturbing” and “unconscionable” if true, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield has said.\nSpeaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Thomas-Greenfield said the United States had not yet confirmed the allegations made on Saturday by the Mariupol city council via its Telegram channel.\n“I’ve only heard it. I can’t confirm it,” she said. “But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.”\nRussia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, igniting a conflict that has led to more than 900 civilian deaths and nearly 1,500 injuries as of March 19, according to the UN human rights office.\nMariupol, a key connection to the Black Sea, has been a target since the start of the war, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a “special military operation” to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.\nThe Mariupol city council also said Russian forces bombed an art school on Saturday in which 400 residents had taken shelter, but the number of casualties was not yet known.\nThe Reuters news agency could not independently verify the reports by the city council. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment, but Russia denies targeting civilians.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Saturday for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow.\nThe US supports those attempts, Thomas-Greenfield said on Sunday, adding that the negotiations “seem to be one-sided”, with little response from Russia.\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the conflict and the response of the 30-member alliance.\nPoland will formally submit a proposal for a peace-keeping mission in Ukraine at the meeting, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said last week.\nWhen asked about the Polish proposal, Thomas-Greenfield reiterated President Joe Biden’s commitment to refrain from sending US troops into Ukraine.\n“Other NATO countries may decide that they want to put troops inside of Ukraine,” she said. “That will be a decision that they have to make.”\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, speaking on CNN later on Sunday, said she would press NATO to strengthen its military capabilities in Eastern Europe and urge all member countries to devote at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defence.\nKallas said the allegations of Ukrainians deported to Russia were reminiscent of thousands of Estonians sent to Siberian labour camps in the 1940s.\n“Right now we are in a different position, because we are NATO allies,” she said. “But we are trying to do everything we can to support and help Ukraine to fight this war.”\nTurkey is also attempting to mediate a ceasefire in Ukraine, which NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg praised during an interview on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press”.\n“Turkey is doing some real effort to try to facilitate, support talks between Russia and Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said. “It’s far too early to say whether these talks can lead to any concrete outcome.”\nEarlier this month, NATO rejected Ukrainian calls to set up a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine to help it protect its skies from Russian missiles and warplanes.\nWhen asked on Sunday whether a no-fly zone would be considered if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, Stoltenberg raised concerns that such a step could escalate the conflict.\n“Our allies support Ukraine,” he said. “But at the same time it is extremely important we prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia that will cause much more damage, much more death, destruction than what we are seeing now in Ukraine.”",

The UN’s IAEA warns that damage to the facility could lead to a nuclear disaster.\nIn 2021, more than half (55.5 percent) of Ukraine’s electricity was produced with nuclear power, followed by coal (23.6 percent), hydropower (6.7 percent) and gas (6.6 percent).\nUkraine has 16 nuclear reactors across four nuclear power plants (NPPs). Zaporizhzhia accounts for nearly half of the total electricity generated by Ukraine’s NPPs and one-fifth (20 percent) of its annual electricity production.\n\nZaporizhzhia is strategically important to Russia because it is only about 200km (125 miles) from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The plant was captured by Russian forces in March but is still run by its Ukrainian technicians.\nIt is located in the southern Ukrainian steppe on the Dnieper River, 550km (342 miles) southeast of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and 525km (325 miles) south of Chornobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident in 1986.",

Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook over a photograph of three soldiers on rooftops, one of them fixing a Ukrainian flag.\n📷Ukrainian troops raised Ukrainian flag on the roof of hospital in Vysokopillya, #Kherson Oblast. #UkraineRussiaWar pic.twitter.com/2D2Na0Rj1o\n— MilitaryLand.net (@Militarylandnet) September 4, 2022\nUkraine began the counteroffensive last week, targeting the south, particularly the Kherson region, which Russia seized early in the conflict.\nAfter Ukrainian forces’ intense shelling of clusters of Russian troops in the region, the Russians banned the movement of residents, the Ukrainian military said on Monday.\n“The Ukrainian counteroffensive is making verifiable progress in the south and the east,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think-tank.\n“The pace of the counteroffensive will likely change dramatically from day to day as Ukrainian forces work to starve the Russians of necessary supplies, disrupt their command and control, and weaken their morale even as counteroffensive ground assaults continue.”\nUkrainian Telegram channels reported explosions at the Antonivsky bridge near the city of Kherson, occupied by Russian forces.\nUkrainian missiles have severely damaged the bridge over the past weeks, but Russian troops were trying to repair it or set up a pontoon crossing or barges to maintain supplies to their units.\nThe Russia-appointed administration of the Kherson region confirmed on Monday the bridge had been seriously damaged by Ukraine shelling and it was closed to traffic.\nPlans for a referendum on Kherson joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation, Russian state-owned news agency TASS quoted Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the administration, as saying.\nRussian-installed officials previously suggested referendums on joining Russia would be held in September in Kherson, as well as in the neighbouring Zaporizhzhia region and the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, to coincide with local elections in Russia.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the counterattack is to retake the strategic city of Kherson, with a population of about 300,000, from the Russians – the first significant urban centre to fall after the invasion on February 24.\nTaras Berezovets, a Ukraine special forces officers, told Al Jazeera the speed of the counterattack to retake Kherson depends largely on when military equipment from the West arrives.\n“Currently the armed forces of Ukraine feel the lack of armoured vehicles for our infantry. We feel the lack of our air forces. We need tanks and we need artillery first of all. From this perspective, I would say any sort of counteroffensive [to retake Kherson city] would be possible after receiving all of these armaments. It will take several months at least,” said Berezovets.\nRussia has launched 25 missile attacks and more than 22 air raids on military and civilian targets in Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the Ukrainian military statement added, keeping up its focus on establishing full control over the Donetsk region.\nMoscow denied any military progress by Ukrainian troops during the start of the counterattack last week, saying many of Kyiv’s soldiers were killed and wounded.\nIt was not possible for Al Jazeera to independently confirm the claims made by either side.\nRussian authorities said the situation was calm around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine after UN inspectors said it had again lost external power.\nThree strong explosions were heard in Enerhodar, the curfew-bound city where the plant is located, but there were no immediate details of damage and casualties, Russia’s official TASS news agency said on Monday.\nUkrainian troops made two attempts to deploy assault teams in the vicinity of the city, it said, adding they were using drones, heavy artillery, and rocket-launching systems.\nThe last main external power line was cut off, although a reserve line kept up the electricity supply to the grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Only one of its six reactors remained in operation, it said.\nRussian troops seized the plant shortly after President Vladimir Putin sent his army over the border on February 24. It has become a focal point of the conflict. Each side has blamed the other for shelling, which has raised fears of a nuclear disaster.\nVladimir Rogov, a pro-Russian official in the Zaporizhzhia region, told Komsomolskaya Pravda radio there had been no shelling or incursions, and IAEA experts were expected to work at the plant until at least Monday.",

                    "title": "What do we know about Ukraine’s use of Turkish Bayraktar drones?",
                    "body": "During Russia’s war on Ukraine, video footage has circulated on the internet showing the Turkish combat drone Bayraktar TB2 successfully striking the Russian army.\nBut as so often during heightened conflicts, it is hard to distinguish between factual events and misinformation – some videos of the drone attacks have already been exposed as the latter.\nGiven the chaotic events on the ground, it is almost impossible to assess how often and how successfully Ukraine has utilised its Turkish drones so far, Mauro Gilli, senior researcher in military technology and international security at ETH Zurich, told Al Jazeera.\n“There have been some video footages allegedly showing the employment of the TB2. Of course, information at this point is fragmented, and it needs to be taken with caution.\n“We do know that Ukraine bought some TB2 over the past years and that Turkey and Ukraine signed an agreement for the production within Ukrainian borders of the TB2 – but, as far as I know, production had not started yet.\n“Allegedly, some transport aircraft delivered some drones shortly before the beginning of the hostilities with Russia,” Gilli said.\nSince 2019, Kyiv has bought dozens of drones from Ankara.\nThey have also been used in Libya and in last year’s battle between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh – when the drones were used by Turkey’s ally Baku.\n“The TB2 produced by the company Bayraktar is one of the two prominent armed drones produced by Turkey [the other being the Anka produced by Turkish Aerospace Industry]. It is cheaper than other Western models, but it has a good performance in key parameters [range, altitude as well as sensors and communication system],” Gilli said.\nBut given Russia’s strength of forces, what impact drones might have in Ukraine?\n“It will very well depend on Russian air defences. Drones like the TB2 are vulnerable to anti-air defence systems. To be effective, they need to be employed in a savvy way, in coordination with other electronic warfare systems that ‘blind’ enemy radars and through appropriate tactics,” Gilli said.\n“However, against capable enemies, these technologies and tactics might not be sufficient. In Libya, Russian forces figured out effective ways to counter Turkish tactics and shoot down their drones. The same [has been] observed in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh,” he added.\n“That Ukraine could strike some Russian ground forces with TB2 suggests either that Russian forces are advancing without air defence – which is very well possible, in light of the logistical and organisational problems Russia has encountered so far. Or that Ukrainian forces acquired also advanced electronic warfare systems. Whether they will have a systematic effect on the outcome of the war, it’s hard to say, but I tend to be sceptical,” said Gilli.\nRegardless of their impact, the use of drones inevitably raises Turkey’s profile.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has maintained amicable relations with Russia and Ukraine for years, but Moscow’s invasion has complicated his balancing act.\n“Turkey and Ukraine were enjoying good and friendly relations before the war,” Erdi Ozturk, associate professor in politics and international relations at London Metropolitan University, told Al Jazeera.\n“Turkey has strongly supported Ukrainian independence in the 1990s. After its independence, they worked closely to establish a stable environment in the Black Sea [through] economic and military cooperation,” he said.\nAs far as Ankara is concerned, Russia is unlikely to change this dynamic.\n“Turkey has been playing an active role with its drones, and eight trucks of humanitarian aid have been delivered to local authorities in Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova. Furthermore, in an hourlong call with Moscow [last] Sunday, Erdogan appealed for an urgent general ceasefire,” said Ozturk.\nHowever, Erdogan still has to be cautious. He cannot afford to favour either side, as this would have severe security and economic consequences.\n“On the fifth day of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Erdogan, one more time, repeated that Turkey could not abandon its ties with Russia or Ukraine,” Ozturk said.\n“Turkey is still trying to perpetuate the balance-based policy, which does not mean that Turkey has been establishing its policies without a dilemma. Instead, Turkey has been in a stuck position between Russia and the West regarding security, economy, and energy,” Ozturk noted.\nBut while Russia is facing off Turkish drones in Ukraine, the Ankara-Moscow relationship is unlikely to suffer, Cristian Nitoiu, lecturer in diplomacy and international governance at Loughborough University London, told Al Jazeera.\n“I’m sure there have been informal discussions between Erdogan and Putin on potential military support from Turkey to Ukraine, including the supply of drones,” he said.\n“Ankara has a dualistic approach, criticising Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity and expressing its support for the Tatar community in Crimea. Turkey also closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to warships, a move which favours Russia, as it does not allow NATO warships to enter the Black Sea in order to aid Ukraine,” Nitoiu said.\nFurthermore, following the shooting of the Russian aircraft in 2015 by the Turkish air force, the two nations have developed early warning strategies and methods for managing potential military tensions.\n“It is likely that Erdogan will inform or even consult Putin before sending military support to Ukraine,” Nitoiu added.",

In a first since the war began, Russia acknowledged its defeat in the region.\nUkraine’s counteroffensive, which began on September 6, took the Kremlin by surprise, both in terms of speed and the dynamism of advances with large pockets in Kharkiv oblast being reclaimed. According to the British defence ministry, in recent days, Ukrainian forces have captured territory at least twice the size of London.\nUkrainian fighters were able to take advantage of a weaker presence of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, following the redeployment of Russian fighters to Donetsk and the southern axis, where a Ukrainian offensive in Kherson presented a threat.\nThe map below shows the areas recaptured by Ukraine since September 6.\nAccording to the ISW, local sources reported on September 7 that Ukrainian forces had struck Izyum and Kupiansk, likely to stop Russian forces from reinforcing the front lines in these cities. Western-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) appear to have played an important role in maximising the effect of the Kharkiv offensive.\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Monday that Ukrainian forces had made “significant progress” and, “benefitted from significant support from the United States and many other countries in terms of making sure that Ukraine has in its hands the equipment it needs to prosecute this counteroffensive”.\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine, the US has committed at least $14.5bn in security assistance to Ukraine, including 16 HIMARS and ammunition, according to the Department of Defense.\nRussian efforts to seize the Donbas region in its entirety have been thwarted by the precision efforts of Ukrainian forces, with Kupiansk and Izyum – both significant logistical hubs for Russian forces – being reclaimed by Kyiv in recent days.\n“Within four days, Ukraine nullified four months of success of the Russian army that cost them a huge amount of victims,” Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russian expert at Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera.\nOne narrow road connects the de-occupied towns of Kupiansk and Izyum to the Russian border, but the Russian retreat did not clog it up, Mitrokhin said, suggesting that a deliberate decision was made by the Kremlin to leave the area and redeploy manpower to the Donbas.\n“The Russian defence ministry made a decision – that apparently came from the very top – to fully withdraw forces from Kharkiv and to use the available resources to hold on to the positions in Donetsk, and perhaps, the border of Luhansk,” Mitrokhin said.\n“The aftertaste is that all of this is but a remake of Russia’s retreat from northern Ukraine in April,” he said.\nMoscow has claimed that the withdrawal of troops on September 10 from the Balakliia-Izyum line was part of a “regrouping” effort.\nHowever, there were some signs of a shift in tone from Russian state media and pro-war reporters and bloggers regarding the pullback and Kremlin-ally and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov stated that if there were no changes to the Russian “special military operation”, then he would contact the Kremlin to “explain the situation on the ground”.\nWhile Ukraine’s counteroffensive does not signal an end to the war, it could suggest a shift of momentum in favour of Ukraine. According to the ISW, Kyiv will likely dictate the location and nature of the fighting, with Russia potentially responding to Ukraine’s military campaigns.\nUkraine’s counteroffensive on the southern axis near Kherson has continued simultaneously with the one in Kharkiv. In the past week, Ukrainian forces targeted Russian ground lines of communication, ammunition depots and military and transportation assets.\nAccording to the ISW, Ukrainian forces made gains at several significant locations on the western bank of the Dnieper River, cutting two bridges across the river and interfering with Russia’s efforts to maintain supplies via barge and ferry.\nNow as the front lines have shifted further east, placing Ukrainian forces within tens of kilometres of the border with Russia, President Zelenskyy seeks to go further, stating in a speech on Monday, “We will oust them from our border.”",

Ukraine has pledged to regain control of Crimea Peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n“The entire Donetsk region will be liberated,” predicted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as his forces stood poised to take the strategic town of Izyum, suggesting Ukrainian forces will soon press their advantage east.\nBut US President Joe Biden warned against great expectations, saying the war would be “a long haul”. Still, Ukraine may have turned a corner in procuring weapons it says it desperately needs.\nGerman daily Suddeutsche Zeitung said the US is now considering sending to Ukraine the Western main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles it has been crying out for.\nIn an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz did not rule out sending his country’s heaviest tank, the Leopard 2, to Ukraine saying, “we will … coordinate closely with our allies. The situation is dynamic.”\nUkraine’s counteroffensive in the northern Kharkiv region began on September 6, even as another counteroffensive in the south begun a week earlier continued to unfold.\nOn September 8, Ukrainian forces took Balakliia, their first major prize, and came within 15km (9 miles) of the key logistics hub of Kupiansk. Lieutenant General Oleksiy Gromov said Ukraine’s counteroffensive had advanced to a depth of 50km (31 miles) behind enemy lines, reclaimed 700sq km (435sq miles) and secured 20 settlements.\nThe counteroffensive picked up speed the following day, liberating 30 settlements and 1,000sq km (621sq miles). Moscow-installed administrator for Kharkiv, Vitaly Ganchev, admitted that Kyiv had scored a “substantial victory”.\nRussia’s defence ministry announced it was rushing reinforcements to the area, as it was caught off-guard by the Ukrainian push. It released video of a convoy of vehicles setting out from Raihorodka in Luhansk region – south of Kharkiv.\nBut it was too little, too late.\nOn September 10, Ukrainian forces recaptured the western half of Kupiansk, which lies astride the Oskil river, and advanced south along the river to reach the outskirts of Izyum, which they recaptured the following day.\nAt its northern extreme, the counteroffensive marched to the Russian border, taking Vovchansk, north of Kharkiv city.\nUkraine recaptured 20 settlements on September 12, re-establishing control as far north as Ternova on the Russian border and as far east as Dvorchina on the west bank of the Oskil river.\nAlthough the Kremlin admitted defeat on September 13, it originally claimed it was tactically retreating from the area west of the Oskil river, which now forms the new front line.\nSome observers told Al Jazeera the Russians did indeed plan a tactical retreat, aware of a coming counteroffensive. Yet there is more evidence pointing to a rout.\nSoldiers of the 1st Motor Rifle Regiment based in Izyum wrote en masse to their commander on August 30 asking for leave, suggesting they knew of the coming battle. Leave would have been unnecessary in a planned withdrawal.\nUkraine put Russian fatalities on September 6, the first day of its Kharkiv counteroffensive, at 460. On day two, it estimated Russian fatalities at 640, and 650 on day three.\nTo put these figures in context – during summer, Ukraine estimated Russian fatalities at 150-200 soldiers a day. After August 24, as Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the south built up with artillery followed by a ground offensive on August 29, those estimates rose to 300-450 dead. The losses in Kharkiv may be the highest daily tolls of the war for Russia.\nThere was further evidence of a disorganised retreat. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces were stealing civilian vehicles to escape. It said about 150 soldiers “departed Borscheva and Artemivka on two buses, one truck and 19 stolen cars,” on September 11. Another Russian unit left Svatove in Luhansk oblast by stealing more than 20 cars from locals, the staff said.\nUkraine’s military intelligence intercepted phone calls of the 202nd motorised rifle regiment while in retreat from Kharkiv. Left without communications and commanders, they asked relatives in Russia to contact the defence ministry hotline in Moscow to ask for instructions or extraction. Half the regiment was captured.\nRussia said its tactical retreat meant to prioritise the fight for Donetsk region in the east, but Ukraine’s advance to the Oskil now exposes all that Russia has gained in Luhansk and Donetsk to an attack from the north.\nRussian forces doggedly continued their offensives to capture Bakhmut, a communications node in Donetsk, even as Kiyv’s forces advanced to their north.\n“Even the Russian seizure of Bakhmut … would no longer support any larger effort to accomplish the original objectives of this phase of the campaign, since it would not be supported by an advance from Izyum in the north,” said the Institute for the Study of War.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n“The continued Russian offensive operations against Bakhmut and around Donetsk City have thus lost any real operational significance for Moscow.”\nThe Kharkiv offensive may have triggered desertions behind the front lines. Ukraine says Russian servicemen fled Svatove, 40km (25 miles) east of the Oskil river, leaving only local Luhansk militiamen to defend it.\nIn the southern Kherson region, satellite images showed all except four vehicles absent at the Russian base in Kyselivka, suggesting that the Donetsk People’s Republic unit that manned it may have fled. And reports surfaced that Russian troops were abandoning Melitopol in the heart of Russian-occupied Zaporizhia region, and retreating to Crimea.\nSuch desertions are encouraging partisans to mobilise. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian partisans had retaken Kreminna, 12km (seven miles) behind enemy lines, and raised the flag there on September 11. Russian troops and collaborators were heading for the border, he said.\nUkraine’s southern counteroffensive also remained active during the Kharkiv operations. The Kakovka operational group reported 500sq km (193sq miles) of Russian-occupied territory have been reclaimed this month, and 13 settlements recaptured. Ukrainian forces have advanced between 4km (2.5 miles) and 12km (seven miles) in various places along the front. “But the invaders still have a lot of strength and capacity,” the group said.\nUkrainian victories have disrupted Russian recruitment, said Ukraine’s general staff. “The current situation in the military theatre and distrust for top command has forced a large number of volunteers to abandon the prospect of combat service,” the staff said.\nWill there be political repercussions for Russian President Vladimir Putin?\nGoing by the results of the local and regional elections held on September 11, Putin still wields influence, as his supporters scored an overwhelming victory. But this is part of a waiting game by an opposition that sensed this was not its moment to strike, Russia observers have said.\n“The number of candidates was the lowest for the last 10 years,” said Stanislav Andreychuk, co-chairman of Golos, Russia’s largest independent election monitor. “Very bright, very strong candidates didn’t take part in elections because political parties didn’t move them [towards elections]. Sometimes, they even cleaned them from their membership lists.”\nOpposition parties have opted to keep their powder dry for now, said Andreychuk. “The main political topic all over the country is war and sanctions. But you can’t really talk about it in public, especially if you are against, because you can get seven or even 10 years in jail. So candidates tried to be very, very careful.”\nYet avoiding the elephant in the room was such a conscious exercise, said Andreychuk, it may even have emphasised Putin’s current political fragility.\n“Everybody understands that everything can be changed immediately,” he said.",

                    "body": "Ukrainian authorities have found a mass grave in woods near the northeastern town of Izyum, days after recapturing it from occupying Russian forces.\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed the discovery of the burial site — containing some 440 bodies — in his address to the country on Thursday night.\nA regional police official said earlier that some of those killed had died in shelling or air raids.\n“The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information – clear, verifiable information – should be available tomorrow,” said Zelenskyy, who had visited Izyum on Wednesday.\nJournalists who travelled to the site described hundreds of graves marked with simple wooden crosses among the trees. A larger grave bore a marker saying it contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers, according to the Associated Press news agency.\nInvestigators were using metal detectors to look for any hidden explosives.\n“I can say it is one of the largest burial sites in a big town in liberated [areas] … 440 bodies were buried in one place,” Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for the Kharkiv region, told the United Kingdom’s Sky News. “Some died because of artillery fire … some died because of air strikes.”\nIt was not possible to immediately verify the Ukrainian claims and there was no immediate response from Russia.\nIn his address, Zelenskyy invoked the killings in Bucha, on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, where Ukrainians found bodies of civilians lying in the streets in early April after Russian soldiers withdrew. He also referenced the southern port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine says tens of thousands of civilians probably died in the Russian assault and prolonged siege.\n“Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izyum. … Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it. The world must bring Russia to real responsibility for this war,” he said.\nRussia has denied targeting civilians or committing war crimes.\nUkraine liberated Izyum after two weeks of rapid gains in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Ukrainian officials say since the start of the month, they have retaken about 9,000sq km (3,400sq miles) of their country’s territory, equivalent to the size of the island of Cyprus.\nOn Thursday, the United States moved to support the counteroffensive with a new package of military aid worth up to $600 million.\nThe White House said the package includes equipment and services, as well as training, but did not elaborate on the type of weapons it was providing. The US has provided more than $15bn in military assistance to Kyiv since Russia began its invasion on February 24.\nUkraine is hoping to push further before the weather turns significantly colder, but Russia has responded with a barrage of air raids, including firing eight cruise missiles at a dam near Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown in central Ukraine. Some 100 homes were flooded as a result of the attack and work is currently under way to repair the damage.\nIn the newly-liberated Kharkiv region, Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Enin said Ukrainian troops have also discovered multiple “torture chambers” where both Ukrainian citizens and foreigners were detained “in completely inhuman conditions”.\n“We have already come across the exhumation of individual bodies, not only with traces of a violent death, but also of torture – cut off ears, etc. This is just the beginning,” Enin said in an interview with Ukraine’s Radio NV.\nHe said that among those held at one of the sites were students from an unspecified Asian country who were captured at a Russian checkpoint as they tried to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory.\nEnin did not specify where the group was held, although he named the small cities of Balakliia and Volchansk as two locations where torture chambers were found. His account could not be independently verified.\n“All these traces of war crimes are now carefully documented by us. And we know from the experience of Bucha that the worst crimes can only be exposed over time,” Enin said,",

The water system had “no military value” and hundreds of thousands of civilians depend on it daily, he said.\n“In order to avoid unnecessary risks, I kindly ask the residents of certain streets to evacuate,” the head of the Kryvyi Rih military administration, Oleksandr Vilkul, said in a statement.\nIn a post on Telegram, Vilkul said 112 homes were flooded, and works to repair the dam on the Inhulets river were under way and that “flooding was receding”.\nKirill Timoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, said in an online post that there had been no civilian casualties in the attack.\nReporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo said emergency crews are working in Kryvyi Rih to mitigate the damage. “This was a strike that clearly caused significant damage to the dam,” he said.\n“It is unclear exactly why the Russians would want to target the dam. But perhaps it is because it is the hometown of Zelenskyy,” he added.\n\nRussian forces have suffered a stunning reversal this month after Ukrainian troops made a rapid armoured thrust in the Kharkiv region in its northeast, forcing a rushed Russian withdrawal.\nUkraine says it has seized some 8,000 square kilometres (4,970 square miles) of territory in the country since the beginning of September.\nHowever, Russia said on Wednesday its forces were hitting back in areas taken back by Ukraine in Kharkiv with “massive strikes”, claiming losses to Ukrainian military servicemen and hardware.\nRussia also said it had captured dozens of Ukrainian soldiers in the southern Kherson and Zaporizhia regions.\nThe United States, which has provided billions of dollars of weapons and support, said it was likely to announce more military aid for Ukraine in the “coming days”.\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are set to discuss Ukraine at a meeting in Uzbekistan on Thursday which the Kremlin said would hold “special significance”.\nAlso on the diplomatic front, the United Nations General Assembly is on Friday due to consider a proposal for Zelenskyy to address the annual gathering of leaders next week with a pre-recorded video.

                    "body": "White House officials have confirmed that the United States will send M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, also known as HIMARS, to war-torn Ukraine.\nThe medium-range rocket systems have long topped the lists of weapons requests by Kyiv as fighting against Russian forces has concentrated in the eastern regions of the country.\nThe US officials confirmed the systems would be part of a new $700m security assistance package to Ukraine that will also include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.\nIn an op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday, Biden wrote that the US will “provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine”, although he did not name the systems by name.\nHe said the weapons are meant to help Ukraine “fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table”.\nThe military package, which is expected to be officially announced on Wednesday, will be the eleventh provided by the US to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24.\nIn total, the US has provided about $4.5bn in military assistance since the invasion, including howitzers approved in April, the most powerful artillery provided prior to the HIMARS.\nHIMARS are a high-tech, lightweight rocket launcher that is wheel mounted, giving it more agility and manoeuvrability on the battlefield.\nEach unit can carry six GPS guided rockets, which can be reloaded in about a minute with only a small crew.\nAnalysts say the system is considerably more reliable than other rocket systems Ukrainian forces currently use.\nThe range of the systems provided by Washington will be about 80km (50 miles), almost double the range of the US-provided M777 howitzers, which entered the Ukrainian battlefield in May.\nIt was not clear on Wednesday how many of the systems the US will send to Ukraine.\nUkrainian officials have long called for longer-range artillery systems to help repel Russia’s advances in the east, a region of sprawling fields that is generally considered more difficult to defend than more dense urban areas.\nOn Saturday, as Russian forces bore down on the strategically significant city of Severodonetsk, Ukrainian presidential adviser and peace talks negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak again said longer-range weapons were needed to match Russian capabilities.\n“It is hard to fight when you are attacked from 70 km away and have nothing to fight back with. Ukraine can return Russia behind the Iron Curtain, but we need effective weapons for that,” Podolyak tweeted.\nThe HIMARS will give Ukraine’s forces the ability to attack further behind Russian lines. They will also be able to launch attacks from a more protected distance.\n“Broadly speaking, Ukraine’s artillery arsenal is outranged and outnumbered by Russia’s,” Samuel Cranny-Evans, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, told Al Jazeera.\nHe said that, if upgraded, systems currently in use by Russia, notably the BM-30 Smerch, can “provide sustained and destructive fire at distances up to 90 km or 120 km”.\nThe HIMARS “will provide Ukraine firstly with the ability to reach these systems if they are operating beyond howitzer range,” he said. “In addition, the longer-range systems can be used to engage Russian logistics and command and control nodes, which are critical to Russia’s ability to sustain the fight.”\nThe effectiveness of the new systems, he added, will ultimately “depend on the Ukrainian ability to conduct reconnaissance and intelligence gathering functions into Russia’s operational depth and coordinate that with the new artillery assets as they enter service”.\nThe US has wrestled with providing weapons that could risk escalating the conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders.\nTo date, Washington has not overtly backed any of the short-range attacks Ukraine has reportedly conducted inside Russian territory, either with rockets, drones or helicopters.\nWhile the artillery provided with the HIMARS could theoretically reach Russia if fired close enough to the border, a US official told reporters on Tuesday “Ukrainians have given assurances they will not use these systems against Russian territory”.\nThe US has said it will not supply Ukraine with the Army Tactical Missile Systems, which have a range of 300km (186 miles).\nRussia has said the US decision to provide the HIMARS would increase the risk of a direct confrontation.\nOn Wednesday, the Kremlin sharply criticised the US decision to supply the rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine, and accused Washington of adding “fuel to the fire”.",

Lieutenant General Oleksiy Gromov said Ukraine’s counteroffensive had advanced to a depth of 50km (31 miles) behind enemy lines, reclaimed 700sq km (435sq miles) and secured 20 settlements.\nThe counteroffensive picked up speed the following day, liberating 30 settlements and 1,000sq km (621sq miles). Moscow-installed administrator for Kharkiv, Vitaly Ganchev, admitted that Kyiv had scored a “substantial victory”.\nRussia’s defence ministry announced it was rushing reinforcements to the area, as it was caught off-guard by the Ukrainian push. It released video of a convoy of vehicles setting out from Raihorodka in Luhansk region – south of Kharkiv.\nBut it was too little, too late.\nOn September 10, Ukrainian forces recaptured the western half of Kupiansk, which lies astride the Oskil river, and advanced south along the river to reach the outskirts of Izyum, which they recaptured the following day.\nAt its northern extreme, the counteroffensive marched to the Russian border, taking Vovchansk, north of Kharkiv city.\nUkraine recaptured 20 settlements on September 12, re-establishing control as far north as Ternova on the Russian border and as far east as Dvorchina on the west bank of the Oskil river.\nAlthough the Kremlin admitted defeat on September 13, it originally claimed it was tactically retreating from the area west of the Oskil river, which now forms the new front line.\nSome observers told Al Jazeera the Russians did indeed plan a tactical retreat, aware of a coming counteroffensive. Yet there is more evidence pointing to a rout.\nSoldiers of the 1st Motor Rifle Regiment based in Izyum wrote en masse to their commander on August 30 asking for leave, suggesting they knew of the coming battle. Leave would have been unnecessary in a planned withdrawal.\nUkraine put Russian fatalities on September 6, the first day of its Kharkiv counteroffensive, at 460. On day two, it estimated Russian fatalities at 640, and 650 on day three.\nTo put these figures in context – during summer, Ukraine estimated Russian fatalities at 150-200 soldiers a day. After August 24, as Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the south built up with artillery followed by a ground offensive on August 29, those estimates rose to 300-450 dead. The losses in Kharkiv may be the highest daily tolls of the war for Russia.\nThere was further evidence of a disorganised retreat. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces were stealing civilian vehicles to escape. It said about 150 soldiers “departed Borscheva and Artemivka on two buses, one truck and 19 stolen cars,” on September 11. Another Russian unit left Svatove in Luhansk oblast by stealing more than 20 cars from locals, the staff said.\nUkraine’s military intelligence intercepted phone calls of the 202nd motorised rifle regiment while in retreat from Kharkiv. Left without communications and commanders, they asked relatives in Russia to contact the defence ministry hotline in Moscow to ask for instructions or extraction. Half the regiment was captured.\nRussia said its tactical retreat meant to prioritise the fight for Donetsk region in the east, but Ukraine’s advance to the Oskil now exposes all that Russia has gained in Luhansk and Donetsk to an attack from the north.\nRussian forces doggedly continued their offensives to capture Bakhmut, a communications node in Donetsk, even as Kiyv’s forces advanced to their north.\n“Even the Russian seizure of Bakhmut … would no longer support any larger effort to accomplish the original objectives of this phase of the campaign, since it would not be supported by an advance from Izyum in the north,” said the Institute for the Study of War.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n“The continued Russian offensive operations against Bakhmut and around Donetsk City have thus lost any real operational significance for Moscow.”\nThe Kharkiv offensive may have triggered desertions behind the front lines. Ukraine says Russian servicemen fled Svatove, 40km (25 miles) east of the Oskil river, leaving only local Luhansk militiamen to defend it.\nIn the southern Kherson region, satellite images showed all except four vehicles absent at the Russian base in Kyselivka, suggesting that the Donetsk People’s Republic unit that manned it may have fled. And reports surfaced that Russian troops were abandoning Melitopol in the heart of Russian-occupied Zaporizhia region, and retreating to Crimea.\nSuch desertions are encouraging partisans to mobilise. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian partisans had retaken Kreminna, 12km (seven miles) behind enemy lines, and raised the flag there on September 11. Russian troops and collaborators were heading for the border, he said.\nUkraine’s southern counteroffensive also remained active during the Kharkiv operations. The Kakovka operational group reported 500sq km (193sq miles) of Russian-occupied territory have been reclaimed this month, and 13 settlements recaptured. Ukrainian forces have advanced between 4km (2.5 miles) and 12km (seven miles) in various places along the front. “But the invaders still have a lot of strength and capacity,” the group said.\nUkrainian victories have disrupted Russian recruitment, said Ukraine’s general staff. “The current situation in the military theatre and distrust for top command has forced a large number of volunteers to abandon the prospect of combat service,” the staff said.\nWill there be political repercussions for Russian President Vladimir Putin?\nGoing by the results of the local and regional elections held on September 11, Putin still wields influence, as his supporters scored an overwhelming victory. But this is part of a waiting game by an opposition that sensed this was not its moment to strike, Russia observers have said.\n“The number of candidates was the lowest for the last 10 years,” said Stanislav Andreychuk, co-chairman of Golos, Russia’s largest independent election monitor. “Very bright, very strong candidates didn’t take part in elections because political parties didn’t move them [towards elections]. Sometimes, they even cleaned them from their membership lists.”\nOpposition parties have opted to keep their powder dry for now, said Andreychuk. “The main political topic all over the country is war and sanctions. But you can’t really talk about it in public, especially if you are against, because you can get seven or even 10 years in jail. So candidates tried to be very, very careful.”\nYet avoiding the elephant in the room was such a conscious exercise, said Andreychuk, it may even have emphasised Putin’s current political fragility.\n“Everybody understands that everything can be changed immediately,” he said.",

With a population of 638, Solokhi lies 20km (12 miles) north of the Ukrainian region of Kharkiv.\n“Seven wounded, another victim was brought late at night. Everyone is provided with qualified medical care, medicines are available in full. One person died. We will provide material assistance to all the victims and the family of the deceased,” Gladkov said on his Telegram channel.\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify Gladkov’s account. If confirmed, it would mark the first death in Russia under Ukraine fire since the start of the war.\nRussian authorities in areas bordering Ukraine have accused Kyiv of a series of attacks, including a helicopter raid on a fuel depot. Ukraine, which has been fighting off the Russian invasion since February 24, has not claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nGladkov described the shelling as “the most severe to date”, adding an apartment building had been destroyed, according to Russia’s state-run news agency TASS.\nA series of explosions was heard on April 27 in three Russian provinces bordering Ukraine, authorities said, and an ammunition depot in Belgorod province caught fire about the same time.\nUkraine Presidential Adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described the attacks as payback and “karma” for Moscow’s invasion.\n“If you [Russians] decide to massively attack another country, massively kill everyone there, massively crush peaceful people with tanks, and use warehouses in your regions to enable the killings, then sooner or later the debts will have to be repaid,” Podolyak said at the time.\nBelgorod province borders Ukraine’s Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, all of which have seen heavy fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine.\nOn April 1, a Russian official alleged two Ukrainian military helicopters flew across the border and bombed a fuel depot in the eastern city of Belgorod. It was the first known air raid by Ukraine’s forces on Russian soil since Moscow invaded its neighbour.\nVideo images of the purported attack posted online showed what looked like several missiles being fired from low altitude, followed by an explosion that sparked a huge fire.\nAt the time, Ukraine’s top security official Oleksiy Danilov denied Kyiv had carried out that attack.\nThe incidents have exposed Russian vulnerabilities in areas close to Ukraine that are vital to its military logistics chains.\nRussia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24 in a “special military operation” to degrade its military capabilities and root out what it calls dangerous nationalists. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed and millions displaced.\nUkrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its troops.\nMansur Mirovalev contributed to this report from Kyiv.",

                    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to stay the course in his campaign against Ukraine, warning if counterattacks continue a “more serious” military response will be unleashed.\nPutin remained steadfast despite strong evidence that his forces incurred heavy losses in the Ukraine counteroffensive this month.\nThe Russian leader said the main goal of the campaign continues to be “the liberation of the entire territory of Donbas” – the areas of eastern Ukraine including Donetsk and Luhansk that are largely Russian speaking.\n“The plan is not subject to adjustment,” Putin said. “Our offensive operations in Donbas itself do not stop. They are going at a slow pace … The Russian army is occupying newer and newer territories.”\nHe accused Ukrainian forces of attempts to carry out “terrorist acts” and causing damage to Russian civilian infrastructure.\n“We are really quite restrained in our response to this for the time being,” Putin said at a news conference on Friday. “If the situation continues to develop in this way, the response will be more serious.”\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to Putin on the phone on Tuesday after a break of several months. According to the German government, the conversation lasted 90 minutes.\n“The Russian president is pursuing his imperialist goal of annexing part of the neighbouring territory,” Scholz told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.\nScholz insisted on a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine, telling Putin it had to include a ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Russian troops, and respect for the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine.\nGerman weapons have helped make “the difference and made possible the successes, the current successes, that Ukraine is recording”, he added.\nScholz said there had “definitely been movement” in Putin’s tone about the war but it was not significant.\nRussian forces are setting up a new defensive line in Ukraine’s northeast after Kyiv’s troops broke through the previous one, defence officials and analysts said on Saturday.\nThe new line of defence is likely between the Oskil River and Svatove, 150km (90 miles) southeast of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, the UK defence ministry said in an intelligence brief.\nThe front-line readjustment comes after a Ukrainian counteroffensive punched a hole through the previous one in the war and recaptured large swaths of land in the northeastern Kharkiv region that borders Russia.\nMoscow “likely sees maintaining control of this zone as important because it is transited by one of the few main resupply routes Russia still controls from the Belgorod region of Russia”, the British military said.\n“A stubborn defence of this area” was likely but it remained unclear whether the Russians would be able to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, it said.\nUkrainian forces continue to cross the key Oskil River in the Kharkiv region as they try to press on in a counteroffensive targeting Russian-occupied territory, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.\nThe institute said in its Saturday report that satellite imagery it examined suggests Ukrainian forces have crossed over to the east bank of the Oskil in Kupiansk, placing artillery there. The river, which flows south from Russia into Ukraine, had been a natural break in the newly emerged front lines since Ukraine launched its push about a week ago.\n“Russian forces are likely too weak to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River if Ukrainian forces choose to resume offensive operations,” the institute said.\nVideos circulating online on Saturday indicated that Ukrainian forces are also continuing to take land in the country’s embattled east.\nOne video showed a Ukrainian soldier walking past a building, its roof destroyed, then pointing up over his shoulder at a colleague hanging the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag over a mobile phone tower. The soldier in the video identified the seized village as Dibrova, just northeast of the city of Sloviansk and southeast of the embattled city of Lyman in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.\nAnother online video showed two Ukrainian soldiers in what appeared to be a bell tower. A Ukrainian flag hung as a soldier said they had taken the village of Shchurove, just northeast of Sloviansk.\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russian forces continued to pound cities and villages with missile strikes and shelling.\nWestern military aid to Ukraine has been crucial in its fight against Russia’s invasion, and the political will to keep sending it must not falter, said Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas on Saturday at a NATO Military Committee meeting.\n“The ongoing counteroffensive proves that military aid takes Ukraine closer to victory and peace. Our focus must be scaling up our aid and weapons deliveries to push back the Russian aggression as soon as possible,” Kallas said in a speech.\nAdmiral Rob Bauer, chair of the NATO Military Committee, also praised Kyiv’s recent battlefield successes.\n“We are all in awe of the immense courage of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people who outmanoeuvre their opponent time and time again … Winter is coming but our support shall remain unwavering. It is crystal clear in that this conflict is bigger than Ukraine. The entire international rules-based order is under attack,” said Bauer.",

                    "body": "Ukraine has accused Russia of “nuclear terrorism” following a missile attack near an atomic plant as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed further gains in an eastern counteroffensive saying invading Russian troops were “clearly in a panic”.\nThe Russian missile struck within 300 metres (328 yards) of the reactors at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in southern Mykolaiv province on Monday, leaving a hole 2 metres (6.5 feet) deep and 4 metres (13 feet) wide, according to Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom.\nThe reactors were operating normally and no employees were injured, it said.\nThe proximity of the strike, however, has renewed fears that Russia’s nearly seven-month-long war in Ukraine might produce a radiation disaster.\nThis nuclear power station is Ukraine’s second-largest after the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has repeatedly come under fire.\nFollowing recent battlefield setbacks, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened last week to step up Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. Throughout the war, Russia has targeted Ukraine’s electricity generation and transmission equipment, causing blackouts and endangering the safety systems of the country’s nuclear power plants.\nThe industrial complex that includes the South Ukraine plant sits along the Southern Bug River about 300km (190 miles) south of the capital, Kyiv. The attack also caused the temporary shutdown of a nearby hydroelectric power plant, shattered more than 100 windows at the complex and severed three power lines, Ukrainian authorities said.\nUkraine’s Defence Ministry released a black-and-white video showing two large fireballs erupting one after the other in the dark, followed by incandescent showers of sparks, 19 minutes after midnight.\nThe ministry and Energoatom called the attack “nuclear terrorism”.\nThere was no immediate comment from Moscow.\nThe missile attack came amid a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region that was hailed as a potential turning point in the war.\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was palpably panicking as his country’s military pressed farther east, paving the way for a potential assault on Moscow’s occupation forces in the Donbas region.\n“The occupiers are clearly in a panic,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address, adding that he was now focused on “speed” in liberated areas. “The speed at which our troops are moving. The speed in restoring normal life,” he said.\nThe Ukrainian leader also hinted he would use a video address to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday to call on countries to accelerate weapons and aid deliveries. “We are doing everything to ensure Ukraine’s needs are met at all levels – defence, financial, economic, diplomatic,” he said.\nUkraine’s armed forces had regained complete control of the village of Bilohorivka, and were preparing to retake all of Luhansk province from Russian occupiers, provincial Governor Serhiy Gaidai said. The village is only 10 km (6 miles) west of Lysychansk city, which fell to the Russians after weeks of grinding battles in July.\n“There will be fighting for every centimetre,” Gaidai wrote on Telegram. “The enemy is preparing their defence. So we will not simply march in.”\nLuhansk and the neighbouring province of Donetsk comprise the industrialised eastern region of Donbas, which Moscow says it intends to seize as a primary aim of what it calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Ukrainian troops have begun to push into Luhansk since driving Russian forces out of northeastern Kharkiv province in their lightning counter-offensive this month.\nIn a sign of nervousness from a Moscow-backed administration in Donbas about the success of Ukraine’s recent offensive, its leader called for urgent referendums on the region becoming part of Russia. Denis Pushilin, head of the Moscow-based separatist administration in Donetsk, called on his fellow separatist leader in Luhansk to combine efforts toward preparing a referendum on joining Russia.\n\nIn the south, where another Ukrainian counter-offensive has been making slower progress, Ukraine’s armed forces said they had sunk a barge carrying Russian troops and equipment across a river near Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region.\n“Attempts to build a crossing failed to withstand fire from Ukrainian forces and were halted. The barge … became an addition to the occupiers’ submarine force,” the military said in a statement on Facebook.\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify either side’s battlefield reports.\nWhile Zelenskyy said Ukraine was “stabilising” the situation in the northeastern Kharkiv region, which is now largely back in Ukrainian hands, Russian forces are fighting to hold on in the city of Kupiansk, which is split in two by the Oskil River.\nOn Monday, a steady stream of civilians was seeking transport out of Kupiansk, fleeing the shellfire and what locals said was the weeklong failure of water and electricity supplies.\n“It was impossible to stay where we were living,” 56-year-old Lyudmyla, who braved the constant crack of shells to cross the river from the disputed east bank to the relative safety of the west, told the AFP news agency.\n“There was incoming fire not just every day, but literally every hour. It’s very tough there, on the other bank of the river.”",

                    "body": "Ukraine’s military said its troops crossed the strategic Oskil River and is preparing an assault on Russia’s occupation forces in the eastern Donbas – the region Moscow has promised to conquer.\nCrossing the Oskil River is another important milestone in Ukraine’s counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. The river flows south into the Siversky Donets, which snakes through the Donbas, the main focus of Russia’s invasion.\nFurther beyond lies Luhansk province, the base for Russia’s separatist proxies since 2014 and fully in Russian hands since July after some of the war’s bloodiest battles.\n“[Ukrainian troops] have pushed across the Oskil. From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” the Ukraine military wrote on Telegram on Monday.\nSerhiy Serhiy Haidai, Ukrainian governor of Luhansk, wrote on Telegram: “Luhansk region is right next door. De-occupation is not far away.”\nKremlin-backed authorities in the east Ukrainian city of Donetsk said on Monday an attack by Ukraine forces in the Russian-controlled city killed more than a dozen people.\nThe Russian military also said it went after Ukrainian forces in several front-line areas, claiming to have inflicted military casualties and damage to hardware.\nThe most recent Russian shelling killed at least eight civilians and wounded 22 others, Ukraine’s presidential office said on Monday.\nClaims by both sides in the conflict could not be independently verified.\nUkrainian forces swept through the Kharkiv region this month after bursting through the front line, sending thousands of Russian troops fleeing while abandoning their tanks and ammunition.\nThe Russian withdrawal marked the largest defeat for Moscow since it withdrew its forces from around the capital Kyiv after a botched attempt to capture the city in the invasion’s opening stage.\nThe setback has increased renewed discussion among Russian nationalist critics of the Kremlin who question why Moscow failed to plunge Ukraine into darkness at the outset of the invasion by hitting all of its main nuclear power plants.\nSince its forces were driven out of Kharkiv, Russia has repeatedly fired at power plants, water infrastructure and other civilian facilities in what Ukraine says is retaliation for battlefield defeats. Moscow denies deliberately taking aim at civilians.\nRussia’s rapid losses over the past few weeks have shaken a Kremlin public relations campaign that has never veered from the line that the “special military operation” is “going to plan”.\nOfficially Russia announced it was moving some troops out of the Kharkiv region to regroup elsewhere. But the losses are being openly acknowledged on state television by commentators calling for escalation.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has promised to continue his campaign against Ukraine, warning of a “more serious” military response to Ukraine’s “acts of terrorism”.\nAt a summit last week, Putin belittled the Ukrainian advance. “The Kyiv authorities announced they have launched and are conducting an active counteroffensive operation,” he said with a grin. “Well, let’s see how it ends up.”",

What exactly does this look like? He didn’t say,” he said. “In general, a full mobilisation would mean that any military (reservist), roughly 18-60 years old, could not leave Russia and would need to join the military.”\nElizondo said Putin’s speech is an indication that he wants to ramp up the Russian military to fight the war in Ukraine. “No matter how you look at it, it is definitely an escalation if you will, and a realisation that perhaps Moscow needs more troops in Ukraine to achieve its military goals.”\n“Beyond that he also did confirm a very big headline out of his speech. He is moving forward with the referendum votes to take place on Ukrainian territory that is occupied by Russia right now. He mentioned Donbas a lot, the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. He also mentioned the region of Zaporizhzia.”",

                    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has taken centre stage at the United Nations General Assembly, with Germany and France condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “imperialism”, Qatar, Senegal and Turkey calling for immediate peace talks, and Lithuania urging the establishment of a war crimes tribunal to punish Moscow’s atrocities.\nStanding at the UN rostrum in New York late on Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said there was “no justification whatsoever” for Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine in February. “This is imperialism, plain and simple,” he said, adding that it spelled disaster not just for Europe, but also for the global, rules-based order.\n“If we want this war to end, then we cannot be indifferent to how it ends,” Scholz said. “Putin will only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realises that he cannot win.” Germany, therefore, he pledged, will not accept a peace dictated by Russia and will continue supporting “Ukraine with all our might financially, economically, with humanitarian assistance and also with weapons”.\nThe ongoing General Assembly is the UN’s first full, in-person leader’s summit since the COVID-19 pandemic and comes as the war in Ukraine approaches its seventh month. That conflict has become the largest war in Europe since World War II, with thousands killed and millions forced to flee their homes.\nThe loss of important grain and fertiliser exports from Ukraine and Russia has meanwhile triggered a global food crisis, especially in developing countries.\nIn two General Assembly votes soon after the Russian invasion, about 140 of the UN’s member nations overwhelmingly deplored Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. But more than 30 countries abstained, including China, India and South Africa.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in an impassioned speech, said no country should stay neutral about condemning the Russian invasion.\n“Those who remain silent today – despite themselves or secretly with a certain complicity – are serving the cause of a new imperialism, a contemporary cynicism that is destroying the world order,” he said, dismissing the narrative that the West was trying to defend outdated values to serve its interests.\n“Who here can defend the idea that the invasion of Ukraine justifies no sanction?” he asked. “Who of you here can consider that the day when something similar with a more powerful neighbour happens to you, there’ll be silence from the region, from the world?”\n“I call on all the members of this assembly to support us on the path to peace and act to force Russia give up the choice of war so that it realises the cost on itself and us and ends its aggression,” he said. “It’s not about choosing a camp between East and West, but the responsibility of everybody to respect the UN charter.”\nLithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda meanwhile called on UN member states to create a tribunal to punish alleged Russian war crimes.\n“There must be no impunity for the brutal crimes and atrocities committed during the war. Guaranteeing justice and accountability is of vital importance from the standpoint of credibility of the United Nations and the international community,” he said, also urging countries buying Russian oil to end imports and “stop financing this bloody war”.\nBut some countries expressed unease at having to choose sides.\n“I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough of the burden of history; that it does not want to be the breeding ground of a new Cold War, but rather a pole of stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a mutually beneficial basis,” said Macky Sall, the president of Senegal and the current chairman of the African Union.\n“We call for a de-escalation and a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine as well as for a negotiated solution to avoid the catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict,” he said. “Negotiations and discussions are the best tools we have to promote peace. I launch an appeal to put together a high-level mediation mission to which the African Union stands ready to contribute.”\nQatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani echoed the call for peace.\n“We are fully aware of the complexities of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and its international dimension, nevertheless, we call for a ceasefire and the immediate pursuit of a peaceful solution to the conflict,” he said. “This is how the matter would eventually end anyway, no matter how long the war lasts. Its continuation would not change this result, but would rather increase the number of victims, and double its severe consequences for Europe, Russia and the global economy in general.”\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, meanwhile, said the deal his country and the UN had recently helped broker on Ukrainian grain exports was one of the global body’s greatest achievements in recent years.\n“As a result of our intense efforts with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, we have ensured that Ukrainian grain reaches the world via the Black Sea,” Erdogan said in his address. “This agreement, which is of critical importance in maintaining global grain supplies, is one of the greatest achievements of the UN in recent years.”\nTurkey, he said, will continue its efforts to end the war with an agreement that is “based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity and independence”.\nOther leaders who spoke on the first day of the general debate included Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Chilean President Gabriel Boric and Swiss President Ignazio Cassis.\nUnited States President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.\nPutin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are not attending. They sent their foreign ministers instead.",

                    "body": "Russian-backed separatists began holding referendums in the occupied areas of eastern Ukraine, a move that triggered a chorus of condemnation.\nThe vote will pave the way for the formal annexation of swaths of territory by Russia after nearly seven months of the war with its neighbour, a former Soviet republic.\nThe Kremlin has used this tactic before. In 2014, it held a hastily called referendum in Ukraine’s Crimea region that also was denounced by the West as illegal and illegitimate. Moscow used the vote as a justification to annex the Black Sea peninsula in a move that was not recognised by most of the world.\nOn Tuesday, authorities in the separatist Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas abruptly announced that referendums on joining Russia. Moscow-backed officials in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions in the south also called votes.\nThe self-styled Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), which President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent states just before the invasion on February 24, have said they want referendums on joining Russia from September 23 to 27.\nThe Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, which are yet to be recognised as independent states by Russia, have also said they will hold their own votes.\nRussia does not fully control any of the four regions, with only about 60 percent of the Donetsk region in Russian hands.\nRussia controls more than 90,000sq km (34,750sq miles) of territory, or about 15 percent of Ukraine’s total area – roughly the size of Hungary or Portugal.\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014. With Crimea and the territory in the four other regions, Russia would gain an area about the same size as the US state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Moscow goes ahead with the referendums and includes the four regions in Russia, then Ukraine – and potentially its Western backers too – would, from a Russian perspective, be fighting against Russia itself.\nThat would raise the risk of a direct military confrontation between Russia and the NATO military alliance, a scenario that President Joe Biden has said could lead to World War III, because NATO members are supplying arms and giving intelligence to Ukraine.\nAs such, a rushed Russian move to formally annex another big chunk of Ukrainian territory would be a major escalation just days after potentially the most significant Russian battlefield defeat of the war in northeastern Ukraine.\nRussia’s nuclear doctrine allows the use of such weapons if it is attacked with nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons.\nUnless Ukraine agreed to stop fighting for its lost territory, Russia would have to commit significant military forces to defend the newly annexed regions – which are still not fully under Russian control.\nThe five-day voting process will take place in the absence of independent monitors and offer ample room for rigging the outcome.\nWhen the referendums were announced earlier this week, the West immediately questioned their legitimacy. US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz referred to them as shams, and French President Emmanuel Macron said they would have “no legal consequences.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also called them “noise” to distract the public.\n\nA day after the referendums were announced, Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of reservists to bolster his forces in Ukraine.\nThe defence ministry said the mobilisation — Russia’s first since World War II — is intended to call up about 300,000 reservists with previous military experience. Observers noted, however, that Putin’s decree is broad enough to allow the military to swell the numbers if needed. Some reports suggest the Kremlin’s goal is amassing one million soldiers.\nThe Kremlin long has shunned taking such a deeply unpopular move, wary of fomenting discontent and eroding Putin’s support base.\nThe latest Ukrainian counteroffensive exposed Russia’s inability to control the 1,000-km (600-mile) frontline with its current limited force of volunteers. Military experts say it will take months to make the newly called-up reservists ready for combat.\nUkraine said the referendums were “naive blackmail” and a sign Russia was running scared.\n“This is what the fear of defeat looks like. The enemy is afraid, and obfuscates primitively,” said Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Zelenskyy.\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said: “The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything.”\nUkraine says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from its territory. Kyiv says it will never accept Russian control over its territory and has called on the West to supply more and better arms to fight Russian forces.\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution.\nAfter Russian forces on February 27, 2014 took control of Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority and was transferred to Ukraine in Soviet times, a referendum on joining Russia was held on March 16.\nCrimea’s leaders declared a 97 percent vote to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. Russia formally added Crimea on March 21, less than a month after the invasion.\nKyiv and the West said the referendum violated Ukraine’s constitution and international law.",

                    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the United Nations to punish Moscow for its invasion, calling for a special tribunal and for Russia to be stripped of its UN Security Council veto.\n“A crime has been committed against Ukraine and we demand just punishment,” Zelenskyy said in a pre-recorded video address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) delivered just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a mobilisation of 300,000 reserves nearly seven months after he first ordered troops to cross the border into Ukraine.\nZelenskyy, wearing his trademark khaki-coloured t-shirt, said Kyiv had a five-point plan to establish a durable peace, which included not only punishing Moscow for its aggression, but the restoration of Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity and the provision of security guarantees.\n“Punishment for the crime of aggression. Punishment for violation of borders and territorial integrity. Punishment that must be in place until the internationally recognised border is restored,” he told the assembly, with his wife, Olena Zelenska, among those in the auditorium.\nIt was the first time Zelenskyy had addressed the world’s leaders gathered together since the Russian invasion, and several delegations rose to their feet and applauded at the end of the speech. Russia and some other delegations remained seated.\nZelenskyy poured scorn on Moscow’s talk of negotiations saying its actions spoke louder than its words.\n“They talk about the talks but announce military mobilisation. They talk about the talks but announce pseudo-referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine,” he said.\nOn Wednesday, Russian-backed separatists in four occupied regions of Ukraine announced they would hold referendums on whether to become part of Russia over four days starting from September 23.\nRussia does not fully control any of the four regions where it plans to hold what Ukraine and its allies have condemned as “sham” votes.\nRussian forces have been accused of war crimes in parts of the country that they have occupied. Russia denies the allegations and says it does not target civilians.\nRussia has not yet had its turn to speak at the UNGA, and Putin is not in New York for the event.\nZelenskyy’s speech was one of the most keenly anticipated at the annual gathering, which has been dominated by the war in his country. Officials from many countries have spoken of their concern at the situation and argued that Russia’s invasion undermines the principles underpinning the UN, including peace, dialogue and respect for sovereignty.\n“It’s an attack on this very institution where we find ourselves today,” said Moldovan President Maia Sandu, whose country borders Ukraine.\nUnited States President Joe Biden also focused heavily on the war in Ukraine as he addressed the assembly.\n“This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold,” he said. “If nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for. Everything.”\nThe fighting has already prompted moves against Russia in some UN bodies, particularly after Moscow vetoed a UN Security Council resolution put forward days after the invasion that demanded Russia end its attack on Ukraine.\nThe veto led to action in the broader General Assembly, which voted overwhelmingly in March to deplore Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, call for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all Russian forces, and urge protection for millions of civilians. Resolutions at the assembly are not binding, but there are no vetoes.\nThe following month, a smaller but still commanding number of member states voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council.\nLast week, the UNGA voted overwhelmingly to allow Zelenskyy to make the video address even as the summit returned fully in-person to UN headquarters in New York following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut there were a few holdouts and Zelenskyy did not let them off the hook.\n“I want to thank the 101 countries that voted for my video address to take place. It was a vote not only about the format. It was the vote about principles. Only seven countries voted against: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria,” Zelenskyy said. “Seven. Seven who are afraid of the video address. Seven who respond to principles with a red button. Only seven. One hundred and one — and seven.”\nThere were also 19 abstentions.",

                    "body": "Russia and Ukraine have carried out a surprise prisoner swap involving nearly 300 people, the largest since Moscow’s invasion began nearly seven months ago.\nThose released include prisoners of war from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Morocco, some of whom had been sentenced to death after being captured in Ukraine and accused of being mercenaries.\nRussia also freed some 215 Ukrainians, including the five commanders who led a prolonged Ukrainian defence of the southern port city of Mariupol earlier this year.\nIn exchange, Ukraine sent back 55 Russians and pro-Moscow Ukrainians and Viktor Medvedchuk, the leader of a banned pro-Russian party who was facing charges of treason.\nThe deal, hammered out with the help of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, had been under preparation for some time and involved intense haggling.\n“This is clearly a victory for our country, for our entire society. And the main thing is that 215 families can see their loved ones safe and at home,” Zelenskyy said in a video address in which he also thanked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his help.\n“We remember all our people and try to save every Ukrainian. This is the meaning of Ukraine, our essence, this is what distinguishes us from the enemy.”\nSaudi Arabia earlier announced the release of the 10 foreigners, following mediation by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, “in continuation of [his] commitment to the humanitarian initiatives towards the Russian-Ukrainian crisis”, according to a statement from the Saudi foreign ministry.\nThe group included five British nationals, two Americans, a Croatian, a Moroccan and a Swedish citizen, the ministry said in a statement, adding that a plane carrying the prisoners had landed in the kingdom and that Saudi authorities were “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries”.\nThe ministry did not identify those released by name.\nBritish legislator Robert Jenrick said Aiden Aslin was among those freed. Aslin was captured earlier this year and sentenced to death by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), one of Russia’s proxies in eastern Ukraine.\nRussia also released US citizens Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, a family representative told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday.\nThe pair, both from Alabama, were captured in June while fighting in eastern Ukraine where they went to support Ukrainian troops resisting Russia’s invasion.\nWe thank @ZelenskyyUa, @AndriyYermak and the Ukrainian government for including 2 U.S. citizens in the prisoner exchange announced today. We thank the Crown Prince and Government of Saudi Arabia for facilitating. We look forward to our citizens being reunited with their families.\n— Jake Sullivan (@JakeSullivan46) September 21, 2022\n\nIn a tweet, Jake Sullivan, US President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, thanked Ukraine “for including 2 U.S. citizens in the prisoner exchange”. Sullivan also thanked the Saudi crown prince and the Gulf country’s government for facilitating their release.\n“We look forward to our citizens being reunited with their families,” he wrote.\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss hailed the release of the British nationals on Twitter as “hugely welcome news” after “months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families”.\nHugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families.\n— Liz Truss (@trussliz) September 21, 2022\n\nTruss said they had been “held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine”, and thanked both Zelenskyy and Saudi Arabia for helping free them.\nDave Des Roches, a senior fellow at the Gulf International Forum, told Al Jazeera that both Russia and Ukraine had an incentive to reach an agreement on the prisoners, while Turkey and Saudi Arabia had an opportunity to show their diplomatic nous.\n“Saudi Arabia and Turkey seem to have a new era of cooperation, but I think (the deal) is basically designed to get positive buzz and enhance the status of both countries that feel they are not getting the respect they deserve in the west at a time when world leaders are meeting in New York,” he said.\nLarge numbers of foreigners have travelled to Ukraine to fight since Russia’s February 24 invasion. Some of them have been caught by Russian forces, along with other foreigners in the country who say they were not fighters.\nSwedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Twitter that the Swedish citizen, held in Donetsk, “has now been exchanged and is well”. She also thanked Ukraine and Saudi Arabia.\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including within the framework of the OPEC+ oil producers group, despite heavy pressure from Washington, Riyadh’s traditional ally, to isolate Russia.\nUkrainian and Russian forces have captured hundreds of enemy fighters since the start of the conflict, with a handful of prisoner exchanges having taken place.\nThe head of the United Nations human rights mission in Ukraine said earlier this month that Russia was not allowing access to prisoners of war (POWs), adding that the UN had evidence that some had been subjected to torture and ill-treatment that could amount to war crimes.\nRussia denies torture or mistreating POWs.\nThe Swedish citizen detained in Donetsk has now been exchanged and is well. I have worked closely with my Ukrainian colleague and would like to extend my deepest gratitude. A warm thank you also goes to Saudi Arabia.\n— Ann Linde (@AnnLinde) September 21, 2022\n",

I am for peace and I don’t want to have to shoot. But coming out now is very dangerous, otherwise, there would be many more people,” said protester Vasily Fedorov, a student wearing a pacifist symbol on his chest.\n“I came to say that I am against war and mobilisation,” Oksana Sidorenko, a student, told AFP.\n“Why are they deciding my future for me? I’m scared for myself, for my brother,” she added.\nDespite Russia’s harsh laws against criticising the military and the war, protests took place across the country. More than 1,300 Russians were arrested in anti-war demonstrations in 38 cities, according to the independent Russian human rights group OVD-Info.\nThe Russian news agency Interfax quoted the interior ministry as saying it had quashed attempts to “organise unauthorised gatherings”.\nAll the demonstrations were stopped and those who committed “violations” were arrested and led away by police pending an investigation and prosecution, it added.\nEarlier, the anti-war movement Vesna Youth Democratic Movement called for demonstrations.\n“We call on the Russian military in units and at the frontline to refuse to participate in the ‘special operation’ or to surrender as soon as possible,” Vesna said in an appeal on its website, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n“You don’t have to die for Putin,” the statement continued. “You are needed in Russia by those who love you. For the authorities, you are just cannon fodder, where you will be squandered without any meaning or purpose.”\nThe website also included a hotline for soldiers within the military who do not want to participate in the war.\nThe demonstrations came after Putin’s televised address earlier on Wednesday, where he said he was defending Russian territories and that the West wanted to destroy the country.\n“We are talking about partial mobilisation, that is, only citizens who are currently in the reserve will be subject to conscription, and above all, those who served in the armed forces have a certain military specialty and relevant experience,” he said.\nAccording to Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, about 300,000 reservists will be called up.\nThe mobilisation is being carried out to control “already liberated territories” Shoigu said, in reference to the Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine.\nRussian-backed separatists in those areas said they will hold referendums on becoming part of Russia between September 23-27.\n",

The quotes below have been translated into English.\n“In such a situation, I consider it necessary to make the following decision, which is fully appropriate to threats we face. Namely, in order to protect our motherland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to ensure the safety of our people and people in the liberated territories, I consider it necessary to support the proposal of the defence ministry and the General Staff to conduct a partial mobilisation in the Russian Federation.”\n“We are talking about partial mobilisation. That is, only citizens who are currently in the reserves and, above all, those who have served in the armed forces, have military skills and relevant experience. Only they will be subject to conscription.”\n“Today our armed forces are operating across a front line that exceeds 1,000 km, opposing not only neo-Nazi formations but the entire military machine of the collective West.”\n“NATO is conducting reconnaissance across the south of Russia. Washington, London and Brussels are directly pushing Kyiv to move military action to our country. They are openly saying that Russia should be defeated on the battlefield by any means.”\n“Nuclear blackmail has also been used. We are talking not only about the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – encouraged by the West – which threatens to cause a nuclear catastrophe but also about statements from senior representatives of NATO countries about the possibility and permissibility of using weapons of mass destruction against Russia: nuclear weapons.\n“I would like to remind those who make such statements about Russia that our country also possesses various means of destruction, and in some cases, they are more modern than those of NATO countries. When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we, of course, will use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people.\n“This is not a bluff. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.”\n“Citizens of Russia can be convinced that our territorial independence and freedom will be provided, and I emphasise this one more time, with all means that we have at our disposal.”\n“Parliaments in the People’s Republics of the Donbas as well as the civil-military administrations in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions have decided to hold referendums on the future of the territories and have appealed to Russia to support such a step. We will do everything to ensure safe conditions to hold the referendums so that people can express their will.\n“We will support the decision on their future, which will be made by the majority of residents in the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.”\n“In its aggressive anti-Russian policy, the West has crossed every line. We constantly hear threats against our country and our people.”\n“The purpose of this West is to weaken, divide and ultimately destroy our country. They are already saying that in 1991 they were able to break up the Soviet Union, and now the time has come for Russia itself that it should disintegrate. And they have been planning it for a long time.”\n“The West is not interested in a peaceful solution and making compromises; they just want to break all negotiations.”",

                    "body": "Russian-backed separatists began holding referendums in the occupied areas of eastern Ukraine, a move that triggered a chorus of condemnation.\nThe vote will pave the way for the formal annexation of swaths of territory by Russia after nearly seven months of the war with its neighbour, a former Soviet republic.\nThe Kremlin has used this tactic before. In 2014, it held a hastily called referendum in Ukraine’s Crimea region that also was denounced by the West as illegal and illegitimate. Moscow used the vote as a justification to annex the Black Sea peninsula in a move that was not recognised by most of the world.\nOn Tuesday, authorities in the separatist Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas abruptly announced that referendums on joining Russia. Moscow-backed officials in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions in the south also called votes.\nThe self-styled Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), which President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent states just before the invasion on February 24, have said they want referendums on joining Russia from September 23 to 27.\nThe Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, which are yet to be recognised as independent states by Russia, have also said they will hold their own votes.\nRussia does not fully control any of the four regions, with only about 60 percent of the Donetsk region in Russian hands.\nRussia controls more than 90,000sq km (34,750sq miles) of territory, or about 15 percent of Ukraine’s total area – roughly the size of Hungary or Portugal.\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014. With Crimea and the territory in the four other regions, Russia would gain an area about the same size as the US state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Moscow goes ahead with the referendums and includes the four regions in Russia, then Ukraine – and potentially its Western backers too – would, from a Russian perspective, be fighting against Russia itself.\nThat would raise the risk of a direct military confrontation between Russia and the NATO military alliance, a scenario that President Joe Biden has said could lead to World War III, because NATO members are supplying arms and giving intelligence to Ukraine.\nAs such, a rushed Russian move to formally annex another big chunk of Ukrainian territory would be a major escalation just days after potentially the most significant Russian battlefield defeat of the war in northeastern Ukraine.\nRussia’s nuclear doctrine allows the use of such weapons if it is attacked with nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons.\nUnless Ukraine agreed to stop fighting for its lost territory, Russia would have to commit significant military forces to defend the newly annexed regions – which are still not fully under Russian control.\nThe five-day voting process will take place in the absence of independent monitors and offer ample room for rigging the outcome.\nWhen the referendums were announced earlier this week, the West immediately questioned their legitimacy. US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz referred to them as shams, and French President Emmanuel Macron said they would have “no legal consequences.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also called them “noise” to distract the public.\n\nA day after the referendums were announced, Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of reservists to bolster his forces in Ukraine.\nThe defence ministry said the mobilisation — Russia’s first since World War II — is intended to call up about 300,000 reservists with previous military experience. Observers noted, however, that Putin’s decree is broad enough to allow the military to swell the numbers if needed. Some reports suggest the Kremlin’s goal is amassing one million soldiers.\nThe Kremlin long has shunned taking such a deeply unpopular move, wary of fomenting discontent and eroding Putin’s support base.\nThe latest Ukrainian counteroffensive exposed Russia’s inability to control the 1,000-km (600-mile) frontline with its current limited force of volunteers. Military experts say it will take months to make the newly called-up reservists ready for combat.\nUkraine said the referendums were “naive blackmail” and a sign Russia was running scared.\n“This is what the fear of defeat looks like.

                    "body": "Russian-backed separatists began holding referendums in the occupied areas of eastern Ukraine, a move that triggered a chorus of condemnation.\nThe vote will pave the way for the formal annexation of swaths of territory by Russia after nearly seven months of the war with its neighbour, a former Soviet republic.\nThe Kremlin has used this tactic before. In 2014, it held a hastily called referendum in Ukraine’s Crimea region that also was denounced by the West as illegal and illegitimate. Moscow used the vote as a justification to annex the Black Sea peninsula in a move that was not recognised by most of the world.\nOn Tuesday, authorities in the separatist Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as the Donbas abruptly announced that referendums on joining Russia. Moscow-backed officials in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions in the south also called votes.\nThe self-styled Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), which President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent states just before the invasion on February 24, have said they want referendums on joining Russia from September 23 to 27.\nThe Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, which are yet to be recognised as independent states by Russia, have also said they will hold their own votes.\nRussia does not fully control any of the four regions, with only about 60 percent of the Donetsk region in Russian hands.\nRussia controls more than 90,000sq km (34,750sq miles) of territory, or about 15 percent of Ukraine’s total area – roughly the size of Hungary or Portugal.\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014. With Crimea and the territory in the four other regions, Russia would gain an area about the same size as the US state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Moscow goes ahead with the referendums and includes the four regions in Russia, then Ukraine – and potentially its Western backers too – would, from a Russian perspective, be fighting against Russia itself.\nThat would raise the risk of a direct military confrontation between Russia and the NATO military alliance, a scenario that President Joe Biden has said could lead to World War III, because NATO members are supplying arms and giving intelligence to Ukraine.\nAs such, a rushed Russian move to formally annex another big chunk of Ukrainian territory would be a major escalation just days after potentially the most significant Russian battlefield defeat of the war in northeastern Ukraine.\nRussia’s nuclear doctrine allows the use of such weapons if it is attacked with nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons.\nUnless Ukraine agreed to stop fighting for its lost territory, Russia would have to commit significant military forces to defend the newly annexed regions – which are still not fully under Russian control.\nThe five-day voting process will take place in the absence of independent monitors and offer ample room for rigging the outcome.\nWhen the referendums were announced earlier this week, the West immediately questioned their legitimacy. US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz referred to them as shams, and French President Emmanuel Macron said they would have “no legal consequences.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also called them “noise” to distract the public.\n\nA day after the referendums were announced, Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of reservists to bolster his forces in Ukraine.\nThe defence ministry said the mobilisation — Russia’s first since World War II — is intended to call up about 300,000 reservists with previous military experience. Observers noted, however, that Putin’s decree is broad enough to allow the military to swell the numbers if needed. Some reports suggest the Kremlin’s goal is amassing one million soldiers.\nThe Kremlin long has shunned taking such a deeply unpopular move, wary of fomenting discontent and eroding Putin’s support base.\nThe latest Ukrainian counteroffensive exposed Russia’s inability to control the 1,000-km (600-mile) frontline with its current limited force of volunteers. Military experts say it will take months to make the newly called-up reservists ready for combat.\nUkraine said the referendums were “naive blackmail” and a sign Russia was running scared.\n“This is what the fear of defeat looks like. The enemy is afraid, and obfuscates primitively,” said Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Zelenskyy.\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said: “The Russians can do whatever they want. It will not change anything.”\nUkraine says it will not rest until every Russian soldier is ejected from its territory.

                    "body": "World leaders at the United Nations have called for Moscow to be held accountable for human rights violations in Ukraine as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov defended his country’s actions in the seven-month war.\nAddressing a meeting of the UN Security Council on alleged atrocities committed in Ukraine since Russia’s February 24 invasion, Lavrov on Thursday accused Ukraine of creating threats against Russian security and “brazenly trampling” the rights of Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine.\nMoscow has called the war a ‘special military operation’.\n“I can assure you that we will never accept this,” said Lavrov, who only sat in the council chamber for his own speech. “Everything I’ve said today simply confirms that the decision to conduct the special military operation was inevitable.”\nUkraine has dominated discussions at the UN, where world leaders are gathering in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe special session of the Security Council took place a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the immediate mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists to fight in a war that has already killed thousands, displaced millions, destroyed cities and undermined the global economy.\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington would continue to support Ukraine to defend itself.\n“The very international order we’ve gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes,” Blinken told the council.\n“We cannot — we will not — let President Putin get away with it.”\nLavrov was not in the room when Blinken and some other US allies spoke, but earlier accused countries supplying weapons to Ukraine and training its soldiers of being parties to the conflict, adding that “the intentional fomenting of this conflict by the collective West remained unpunished”.\nUkraine’s Western allies, he claimed, “have been covering up the crimes of the Kyiv regime”.\n \nThe US announced nearly $3bn in new military aid to Ukraine last month, making it the single largest US aid package for Ukraine since Russian forces invaded their neighbour.\nThursday’s meeting marked at least the 20th time the Security Council had met on Ukraine this year.\nThe council has been unable to take any meaningful action on Ukraine because Russia is a permanent veto-wielding member. The US, France, the United Kingdom and China — the four other permanent members — also have vetoes.\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan told the session there were “reasonable grounds” to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the court, which began investigations in March, had been committed in Ukraine.\nHighlighting evidence gathered on visits to Ukraine, Khan said the ICC investigation priorities were the intentional targeting of civilian objects and the transfer of populations from Ukraine, including children.\n“In my view the echoes of Nuremberg should be heard today,” he told the Security Council, referring to the historic Nazi war crimes trials that took place in Germany at the end of the Second World War.\nKhan has visited Bucha, where the discovery of dozens of bodies in streets and mass graves horrified the world.\nAt the time, Moscow dismissed the atrocities as fake, and on Thursday Lavrov dismissed Ukraine’s efforts to blame Russia as a “propaganda operation”.\nKhan pushed back, telling Security Council members including Lavrov: “When I went to Bucha, and went behind St Andrew’s church, the bodies I saw were not fake.”\nThe US has said that authorities have “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” up to 1.6 million Ukrainians to Russia since the invasion, basing its estimates on a variety of sources, including Moscow.\nOpening the meeting, UN chief Antonio Guterres said the UN rights body had seen “a catalogue of cruelty — summary executions, sexual violence, torture and other inhumane and degrading treatment” against civilians and prisoners of war.\n“All these allegations must be thoroughly investigated, to ensure accountability,” he said, without pointing the finger at Russia.\nIn a special video address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) a day before the special session, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for a special tribunal and “punishment” for Russia over its invasion of a sovereign nation and abuses.\nThat call was reiterated by Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at the Security Council.\nKuleba added that officials like Lavrov also bore some responsibility for the atrocities.\n“Russian diplomats are directly complicit, because their lies incite these crimes — and cover them up,” Kuleba said.\nAsked if he planned to speak to Lavrov, he said he would “keep safe social distance”.\nThe secretary-general also expressed concern about plans for “so-called ‘referenda'” on joining Russia that are due to take place in some parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine from Friday.\nThe votes on becoming part of Russia, announced just this week, will continue until Tuesday in four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, which together make up about 15 percent of the country’s territory. Putin has also threatened the use of nuclear weapons with former president and ally Dmitry Medvedev warning on Thursday that Moscow could use any weapons in its arsenal, including strategic nuclear weapons, to defend territories that are incorporated into Russia.\n“Any annexation of a state’s territory by another state resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the UN Charter and of international law,” Guterres said.\nBlinken said the plan added “fuel to the fire” just as Kyiv had won back swathes of land Russia had taken in the Kharkiv region.\nIt was critical to show that “no nation can redraw the borders of another by force,” he stressed.\nChina’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the priority was to resume dialogue without conditions and for both sides to exercise restraint and not escalate tensions.\n“China’s position on Ukraine is clear. The sovereignty, territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and the reasonable security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously,” Wang said.",

The thinly veiled nuclear threat drew immediate condemnation from an array of Western leaders.\nMedvedev, who regularly issues aggressive statements on the West and Ukraine, added that the protection of all the territories would be significantly strengthened by the Russian armed forces.\n“Russia has announced that not only mobilisation capabilities, but also any Russian weapons, including strategic nuclear weapons and weapons based on new principles, could be used for such protection,” he said.\n\nThe votes to join Russia are due to take place in the Russian-held parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia provinces, as well as part of Mykolaiv province, from Friday – and are widely expected to produce results overwhelmingly endorsing joining Russia.\nThe votes, which will take place under military occupation without any outside oversight, have been labelled shams by Kyiv and its Western allies.\nIf formally admitted to the Russian Federation, the occupied territories, where Ukrainian counteroffensives have gathered pace in recent weeks, will under Moscow’s nuclear doctrine, be entitled to protection from Russian nuclear weapons.\nMoscow does not fully control any of the four regions it is expected to try to annex, with only around 60 percent of Donetsk and 66 percent of Zaporizhia currently held by the Russian army.",

Another had his toenail ripped off and was slammed in the head with the butt of a rifle.\nUkrainian officials described their treatment as torture.\n“Every day we were cleaning toilets and bathrooms,” Dilukshan Robertclive, one of the former captives, said. “Some days Russians came and beat our people, our Sri Lanka people.”\nFour of the seven were medical students in the city of Kupiansk and three were working there when Russian forces poured across the border in late February and occupied large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine.\nThe group said they were captured at the first checkpoint out of Kupiansk and then taken to Vovchansk, near the border with Russia, where they were held in the factory with about 20 Ukrainians.\n“They took our passports, other documents, phones, clothes, and locked us up in a room,” said Sharujan Gianeswaran. “There were also Ukrainian people with us, and they were questioned and sent away in 10 days, 15 days or one month. With us, they never spoke, because they could not understand our language.”\nUkraine police said the factory housed a Russian “torture centre” – one of 18 in the Kharkiv region.\n“They were bound and blindfolded. After that they were captured and then taken to the city of Vovchansk,” said Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the investigative department of the National Police in Kharkiv.\n\nSix among the group said they were held in a large upstairs room. The seventh, the only woman, was kept in a dark cell by herself, her companions said. The woman wept silently and did not speak as the group told their story on Saturday.\nOne man said he was shot in the foot by his Russian captors. Another had a toenail ripped off after the soldiers repeatedly bashed it with the butt of a rifle. The men showed their injuries to journalists.\n“Most of the time we could not understand what they told us and we were beaten for that,” Gianeswaran said.\nIt dawned upon the Sri Lankans that battle lines were shifting only when Russian soldiers ordered them to help load trucks with food and weapons.\nAs the last trucks raced away, the group asked fruitlessly for their passports and documents back, knowing to move around without them would be impossible in a country filled with checkpoints.\nRussian troops captured several cities and towns in northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region early in the war. Ukrainian troops retook the area during a swift counteroffensive earlier this month.\nWhen the Sri Lankans realised the Russians were gone on September 10, the group left the factory and started walking towards the city of Kharkiv, having no real idea how to get to the regional capital that remained in Ukrainian hands.\n“We walked on that road for two days and were exhausted and hungry. We had no food or money to buy food,” Gianeswaran said.\nThey slept on the side of the road and walked until they reached a river. But with so many bridges in the region destroyed by one side or the other in months of fighting, they could find no way to cross.\nFinally, someone noticed their plight, gave them shelter, and called for a ride from security forces.\nPolice said the group was picked up in the Chuhuiv area, 70km (40 miles) from where they started. They are in Kharkiv now with no idea of what the future holds. Robertclive said they are psychologically damaged by their months in captivity.\nBut the men smiled when asked how they felt when they realised the worst of their ordeal was at an end.\n“They [Ukrainians] have given us food and clothing,” Gianeswaran said. “We thought we were going to die but we are saved and are being well looked after.”",

From that moment, on May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later came to be called the Wagner Battalion,” Prigozhin said, who has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n“I am proud that I was able to defend their right to protect the interests of their country.”\nPrigozhin, known as “Putin’s chef” because of his company’s Kremlin catering contracts, has been sanctioned by the United States and European Union for his role in Wagner.\nThey also accuse him of funding a troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency that Washington says tried to influence US elections.\nPrigozhin has previously sued outlets including investigative website Bellingcat, Russian news site Meduza, and now-shuttered radio station Echo of Moscow for reporting his links to Wagner.\nWagner was founded in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and started providing support to pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.\nIn July, the United Kingdom’s defence ministry said the Wagner Group had likely been given responsibility for specific sectors of the front line in war-torn eastern Ukraine, in a similar manner to normal army units.\nThis new level of integration between the armed group and the Russian army “further undermines the Russian authorities’ long-standing policy of denying links between [private military companies] and the Russian state”, it said at the time.",

                    "body": "Sudden and unexplained gas leaks detected in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines from Russia to Germany have prompted investigations by European countries into the cause amid fear of possible sabotage.\nDenmark’s armed forces on Tuesday released video showing bubbles rushing to the surface of the Baltic Sea above the pipelines, and said the largest gas leak had caused surface disturbances of well over one kilometre in diameter.\nAn energy standoff over Russia’s war in Ukraine halted flows through Nord Stream 1 and prevented the onset of flows through the parallel Nord Stream 2.\nPlunging Russian gas supplies have caused prices to soar in Europe, where countries have struggled to find alternative supplies of energy used to heat homes, generate electricity and run factories.\nThe leaks overshadow the inauguration of the long-awaited Baltic pipeline that will bring Norwegian gas to Poland in efforts to bolster Europe’s energy independence from Moscow.\nHere is a breakdown of what is known so far:\n\nThe operator of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline reported a sudden drop in pressure overnight on Monday, with a spokesperson suggesting there could have been a leak.\nThis was followed by a Danish Energy Authority statement that a leak had likely occurred in one of the two Nord Stream 2 pipelines lying in Danish waters.\nA few hours later, Nord Stream AG, operator of another undersea gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, said it was looking into a drop in pressure in Nord Stream 1.\nSweden’s Maritime Administration said on Tuesday that it had warned of two leaks on Nord Stream 1 in Swedish and Danish waters.\nAnders Puck Nielsen, a researcher with the Center for Maritime Operations at the Royal Danish Defence College, said the timing of the leaks was “conspicuous” given the ceremony for the Baltic Pipe, a new system that will bring Norway’s gas to Poland.\nHe said perhaps someone sought “to send a signal that something could happen to the Norwegian gas”.\n“But I think if we look at who would actually benefit from disturbances, more chaos on the gas market in Europe, I think there’s basically only one actor right now that actually benefits from more uncertainty, and that is Russia,” Puck Nielsen said.\nTwo leaks were detected on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which stopped delivering gas to Europe last month, both in an area northeast of the Danish island of Bornholm.\nDanish authorities have asked ships to stay clear of Bornholm by a five nautical mile radius after the leak in Nord Stream 2, which has yet to enter commercial operations. The plan to use it to supply gas was scrapped by Germany days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February.\nBoth pipelines still contain gas under pressure, but are not delivering the fuel to Europe.\nEach line of the pipeline consists of about 100,000 24-tonne concrete-weight coated steel pipes laid on the seabed. The pipelines have a constant internal diameter of 1.153m, according to Nord Stream.\nSections lie at a depth of around 80-110m.\nIt is not yet clear. Analysts and experts say such leaks are very rare, and Nord Stream AG has called leaks on three strings of the offshore gas pipelines “unprecedented”.\nPossible causes range from technical malfunctions to a lack of maintenance, to even possibly sabotage.\nThe Swedish National Seismic Network recorded two “massive releases of energy” shortly prior to, and near the location of, the gas leaks, Peter Schmidt, an Uppsala University seismologist, told AFP.\nUkraine said the leaks were likely the result of a “terrorist attack” carried out by Moscow.\n“The large-scale ‘gas leak’ from Nord Stream 1 is nothing more than a terrorist attack planned by Russia and an act of aggression towards the EU,” Kyiv’s Presidential advisor Mikhaylo Podolyak said on Twitter.\nThe Kremlin has said it did not rule out sabotage as a reason behind the damage, adding it was an issue affecting the energy security of the “entire continent”.\nPoland’s prime minister said the leaks were an act of sabotage, while Denmark’s leader said it could not be ruled out.\nThe European Commission said it was premature to speculate.\nGerman Geology Research Centre GFZ said on Tuesday that a seismograph on Bornholm showed spikes at 00:03 GMT and 17:00 GMT on Monday, when the pressure losses occurred.\nKathryn Porter, an energy consultant at Watt-Logic, a United Kingdom-based independent energy consultancy, said it was extremely “rare” for such a series of leaks to occur within the same general area.\n“This is pretty unprecedented,” Porter told Al Jazeera. “Everyone is scratching their heads to try and understand what has happened here and what the motivation behind it could be.\n“For pipes to fail, normally you either have something like corrosion or fatigue, but Nord Stream 2 is a brand new pipe. And you could look at maybe some sort of construction problem, such as faulty welding, but on the other hand, there are now issues with Nord Stream 1 and that’s been operating since 2012.\n“So it is very difficult to come up with a rational explanation for these things.”\nFor the Nord Stream 2 leak, the head of Denmark’s Energy Agency, Kristoffer Bottzauw, told Reuters it was too early to say who would conduct the investigations. Bottzauw added that no one has been to look at the pipeline yet.\nThe Swedish Armed Forces, the Coast Guard, the Swedish Maritime Administration and other relevant authorities are taking necessary measures, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said.\nGermany on Monday said it was coordinating a response with police, local officials and the energy agency.\nBjorn Lund, director of Swedish National Seismic Network told Al Jazeera that the group detected two explosions on Monday in the vicinity of the Danish island of Bornholm, “very close” to the location where Swedish maritime authorities said leaks were occurring.\nLund said it’s “very clear” that there wasn’t an earthquake. The network is looking at data to compare the recent explosions to the blasts that the Swedish navy sets off in the water during training exercises near the coast.\n“We have quite a lot of data on blasts in the water… [the navy] often let us know about the particulars of that. So, the data from yesterday’s blast are very similar. There’s no doubt that these are explosions occurring in the water,” Lund said.\n“Of course [the explosions set off by the Swedish navy] are closer to the coastline, closer to our stations… but we would like to see anything that stands out in the data in yesterday’s blasts that would indicate that there is something else involved than just a pure blast, by some explosive device. We’ll see if we can get any more information about that.”\nThe extent of the damage means the Nord Stream pipelines are unlikely to be able to carry any gas to Europe this winter even if there was political will to bring them online, analysts at the Eurasia Group said.\n“Depending on the scale of the damage, the leaks could even mean a permanent closure of both lines,” analysts Henning Gloystein and Jason Bush wrote.\n“Leaks of this size are a severe safety and environmental hazard, especially should Russia not stop pumping gas into the system,” the analysts said.\nGas leaking from the damaged Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea will continue for several days and perhaps even a week, the Danish Energy Authority said.\nVessels could lose buoyancy if they enter the area, and there might be a risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air, but there were no risks associated with the leak outside the exclusion zone, it said.\nThe leak would only affect the environment in the area in which the gas plume in the water column is located, and the escape of the greenhouse gas methane would have a damaging impact on the climate.\nDanish authorities asked that the level of preparedness in Denmark’s power and gas sector be raised after the leaks, a step that would require heightened safety procedures for power installations and facilities.",

                    "body": "Russia is poised to formally annex parts of Ukraine after “referendums” in four occupied regions to join Russia that have been condemned by the Ukrainian government and its allies.\nArmed troops had gone door-to-door with election officials to collect ballots in five days of voting in Russian-occupied regions that make up about 15 percent of Ukrainian territory.\nMoscow-installed administrations in the four regions of southern and eastern Ukraine claimed on Tuesday night that 93 percent of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhia region supported annexation, as did 87 percent in the Kherson region, 98 percent in the Luhansk region and 99 percent in Donetsk.\nThe suspiciously high margins in favour were widely characterised as a bogus land grab by an increasingly cornered Russian leadership following recent military losses in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine.\n“Forcing people in these territories to fill out some papers at the barrel of a gun is yet another Russian crime in the course of its aggression against Ukraine,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said, adding that the balloting was “a propaganda show” and “null and worthless”.\nThe ministry asked the European Union, NATO and the Group of Seven major industrial nations to “immediately and significantly” step up pressure on Russia with new sanctions and by significantly increasing their military aid to Kyiv.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged the EU’s 27 member countries to agree on a new package of sanctions on Russian officials and trade in response to the “sham referendums”. She labelled the ballots “an illegal attempt to grab land and change international borders by force”.\nUS State Department Spokesman Ned Price stressed the four areas “are and will remain part of Ukraine” and said that “additional measures” against Russia would be announcing in the coming days.\n“Let’s be clear: The results are completely fabricated and do not reflect the will of the people of Ukraine,” Price told a press briefing. “This is the will of Moscow, not the free will of Ukraine or its people. Because we’ve seen this movie before, we know what will come next. We expect Russia to use these sham referenda as a false pretext to attempt to annex Ukraine’s territory.”\nPro-Russia officials in the four regions said they would ask Russian President Vladimir Putin to incorporate their provinces into Russia on the basis of announced vote results. Separatist leaders Leonid Pasechnik in Luhansk and Denis Pushilin in Donetsk said they were leaving for Moscow to settle the annexation formalities.\nAl Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, reporting from Moscow, said Putin was expected to “officially declare” the annexation of the four regions following those meetings and after Russia’s parliament has given its approval for such moves. Reports suggest this could take place before the end of this week.\nWestern countries, however, dismissed the balloting as a meaningless pretence staged by Moscow in an attempt to legitimise its invasion of Ukraine launched on February 24.\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Washington would propose a Security Council resolution to condemn the referendums. The resolution would urge member states not to recognise any altered status of Ukraine and include a demand for Russia to withdraw its troops from its neighbour, she tweeted.\nThe Kremlin remained unmoved amid the hail of criticism. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, at the very least, Russia intended to drive Ukrainian forces out of the Donetsk region, where Moscow’s troops and separatist forces currently control about 60 percent of the territory.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine was determined to reclaim all the territory that Russia has seized during seven months of war. At the same time, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak insisted that annexation by Russia would change nothing on the battlefield.\n“We will liberate our territory by military means,” Podolyak said. “And for us, our actions depend not so much on what the Russian Federation thinks or wants, but on the military capabilities that Ukraine has.”\nRussia is calling up 300,000 reservists to fight in the war and warned it could resort to nuclear weapons after this month’s counteroffensive by Ukraine dealt Moscow’s forces heavy battlefield setbacks. The partial mobilisation is deeply unpopular in some areas – triggering protests, scattered violence and Russians fleeing the country by the tens of thousands.\nMeanwhile, three explosions were heard, and then electricity cut out in Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, Reuters news agency reported.\nUS officials said Washington is preparing a new $1.1bn weapons package for Ukraine that will be announced soon.\nEurope is also investigating what Germany, Denmark and Sweden have said were attacks that caused major leaks into the Baltic Sea from two Russian gas pipelines at the centre of an energy standoff. Officials did not say who they believed may be responsible.",

In Zaporizhia, a Russian-appointed official put the figure at 93.1 percent. In Kherson, the head of the voting committee said the “yes” vote was above 87 percent.\nDenis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said 99.2 percent of participants in the region had voted to join Russia. In all four areas, officials said all the ballots had been counted.\nWithin the occupied territories, ballot boxes were reportedly taken from house to house in what Ukraine and its allies have called an illegitimate, coercive exercise to create a legal pretext for Russia to annex the four regions.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin could then portray any Ukrainian attempt to recapture its territory as an attack on Russia itself. He said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend the “territorial integrity” of Russia.\nAs voting concluded, the United Nations Security Council held an open session on the referendums in New York City.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to the body in a virtual address shortly after word came that residents in the Zaporizhia region had reportedly voted to join Russia.\n“In front of the eyes of the whole world Russia is conducting this so-called sham referendum on the occupied territory of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “People are forced to fill out some papers while being threatened by submachine guns.”\nPeople who had left the four regions for Russia were also able to vote and state news agency RIA said early counts showed numbers in excess of 96 percent in favour of the Ukrainian territory coming under Moscow’s rule.\nPutin ally Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, posted a brief celebratory message on Telegram. “The referendums are over,” he said. “The results are clear. Welcome home, to Russia!”\nUkraine has repeatedly warned that the Russian annexation of its regions would destroy any chance of peace talks with Moscow, which began its invasion seven months ago.\n“There is nothing to talk about with [the] current Russian president,” Zelenskyy said.\nThe votes were hastily arranged within a few days after Ukraine routed Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region, and made gains in the south as a September counteroffensive gathered momentum.\nKyiv’s allies reiterated their condemnation of the referendums, with Canada saying it would impose new sanctions.\n“Canada does not – and will not ever – recognize the results of Russia’s illegitimate referendums or its attempted, illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement on Wednesday that was shared on social media.\n“Let me be clear: Ukraine’s borders will not change. Ukraine’s territory will remain Ukraine’s.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Kryvyi Rih just west of Zaporizhia, said most people she spoke to said they already “know the results of the referendum, without waiting the full five days of voting. Other people are worried about what happens after the referendum.\n“We saw over the past five days, civilians trying to get out of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson, and they’ve been saying all along the same thing – some would tell you that this referendum for them was the last [straw].\n“They said that, lately, it had become much more strict and much harder to live, but there is that fear of mobilisation [into the Russian forces],” Abdel-Hamid said.\nThe votes follow a similar referendum conducted in Crimea after Russia seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 when Moscow-backed leaders declared a 97 percent vote to join Russia. The annexation has never been recognised by the international community.\nSpeaking on state TV on Tuesday, Putin said the votes were to protect ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people from alleged persecution. Kyiv has denied any such discrimination.\nMoscow has acted in recent months to “Russify” areas under its control, including by issuing people with Russian passports and rewriting school curriculums.\nValentina Matviyenko, head of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said that if the vote results were favourable, Russia could consider annexing the four regions on October 4, three days before Putin celebrates his 70th birthday.\nAt the UN, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council meeting that the body “remains fully committed” to Ukraine’s territorial integrity “within its internationally recognised borders”.\nWhile Moscow’s veto means there is no chance the Security Council will reach a consensus on Russia’s annexation, the United States intends to submit a resolution urging member states “not to recognize any altered status of Ukraine and obligating Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine,” said US envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\nChina, Moscow’s closest major ally since the Ukraine invasion, has yet to overtly condemn the offensive, but it told the Security Council that the “territorial integrity of all countries should be respected”.\nAs Russia began releasing the results of the referendums, Medvedev issued a blunt new nuclear warning.\n“I want to remind you – the deaf who hear only themselves: Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary,” he said on social media.\nPentagon Spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said the US was taking the reiterated threat “seriously” but had seen nothing to cause Washington to change its nuclear posture.\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said: “Russia must know that the nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”",

                    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has proclaimed the annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian regions at a signing ceremony in the Kremlin.\nUkraine, Western countries and the United Nations secretary-general have denounced the move, which represents a major escalation in the war that began with Russia’s invasion on February 24.\nAt the ceremony on Friday, Putin said Russia has “four new regions”, calling the residents of Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions “our citizens forever”.\n“This is the will of millions of people,” he said in the speech before hundreds of dignitaries at the St George’s Hall of the Kremlin.\n“We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means,” he added, calling on “the Kyiv regime to immediately cease hostilities and return to the negotiation table”.\nIn one of his toughest anti-American speeches in more than 20 years in power, Putin signalled he was ready to continue what he called a battle for a “greater historical Russia”, slammed the West as neo-colonial and as out to destroy his country, and without evidence accused Washington and its allies of blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines.\n\nThe signing ceremony came three days after the completion of Kremlin-orchestrated “referendums” in the four regions, which are largely or partly occupied by Russian or Russian-backed forces.\nMoscow’s proxies in the occupied regions have claimed majorities of up to 99 percent in favour of joining Russia. Western governments and Kyiv have dismissed the hastily organised votes as breaching international law, and charge they were coercive and wholly unrepresentative.\nShortly after the ceremony, Russia vetoed a UN resolution that would have declared its referendums as having “no validity” and urged all countries not to recognise any “purported annexation” of the territory by Moscow.\nThe vote on the resolution in the 15-member Security Council was 10-1, with China, India, Brazil and Gabon abstaining.\nUS Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said before the vote that in the event of a Russian veto, the US and Albania – which sponsored the resolution – would take it to the 193-member General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, “and show that the world is still on the side of sovereignty and protecting territorial integrity”.\nEarlier on Friday, the Kremlin warned that Ukrainian attacks against any of the annexed regions would be considered aggression against Russia itself. In his speech, Putin said Russia would defend its new territory with all the means at its disposal.\nThe exact details of Russia’s annexation remain unclear but it appears that Russia is laying claim to about 109,000sq km (42,000sq miles) of Ukrainian territory, or about 18 percent, in addition to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\nIf Russia could establish control over the whole area it claims, Putin would have annexed about 136,000sq km (52,510sq miles) or more than 22 percent of Ukraine, whose borders Russia recognised in a treaty after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nThe United States and United Kingdom have announced new sanctions against Russia in response to the move, which US President Joe Biden said would hurt those who provided political or economic support to the annexation drive.\n“We will rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable. We will continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment it needs to defend itself, undeterred by Russia’s brazen effort to redraw the borders of its neighbour,” Biden said in a statement.\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg accused Putin of provoking “the most serious escalation” of the war since it began on February 24, but said he would not succeed in deterring the alliance from supporting Kyiv.\nIn Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was only ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president.\nHe also announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of NATO, something Moscow fiercely opposes, and accused Russia of redrawing borders “using murder, blackmail, mistreatment and lies”.\nHe said however that Kyiv remained committed to the idea of co-existence with Russia “on equal, honest, dignified and fair conditions”.\n“Clearly, with this Russian president, it is impossible. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,” Zelenskyy said.\nOn Thursday, UN chief Antonio Guterres told reporters that “any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned”.\nHe called the annexation a “dangerous escalation”.\nMoscow has already taken a series of steps in what observers call efforts to “Russify” the annexed regions, a process that is most advanced in the occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, where it has handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to residents since 2019 and almost completely replaced Ukraine’s hryvnia currency with the Russian rouble.\nIn the occupied areas of all four regions, access to Ukrainian TV and mobile phone networks has been cut and only Russian channels and telecoms providers are available.\nSchools previously teaching the Ukrainian curriculum are being forced to adopt a new Russian one.\nMeanwhile, the pro-Russian separatist regions in Donetsk and Luhansk have their own flags, which will soon be replaced by Russia’s, while billboards on streets in Kherson and Zaporizhia hail their future as part of Russia.\nIn the speech, Putin urged Ukraine to cease military action and return to the negotiating table.\nThe Ukrainian government has pledged to recapture all the lands seized by Russia and said Moscow’s decision to annex the territories had destroyed any prospect of talks.\nPutin further decried the West’s backing of Ukraine in the conflict as an attempt to turn Russia into a “colony” and “crowds of slaves”.\n“After the collapse of the USSR, the West decided that the world would forever have to put up with its dictates,” Putin said on Friday, referring to the Soviet Union.\n“The West expected that Russia would not be able to cope with such dictates and fall apart … but Russia has been reborn and strengthened.”\nStill, Patrick Bury, a senior lecturer in security at the University of Bath in the UK, noted the speech – which seemed “more aimed at the global audience” – did not contain any specific ultimatum to Ukraine in terms of the region, nor did it contain any “mention of nuclear escalation”.\nThe omissions allay some concerns of a more immediate threat from Russia, he told Al Jazeera.\n“So the security implications now are: what does Ukraine do with these oblasts, do they continue attacking, and I imagine they will, in the short term?” he said. “And how does Russia respond?”",

They cannot be called genuine expression of the popular will,” Guterres said.\nHe described the planned annexation of the regions as having “no place in the modern world”.\n“We are fully committed to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” he said, calling on Russia to de-escalate tensions.\n“It is time to step back from the brink” and “end this devastating and senseless war”, he added.\nRussia, one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, is mandated to uphold the UN Charter, which prohibits the threat or use of force and champions the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday accused Russia of making a “land grab” and pledged again that the United States will never recognise annexation by Moscow.\n“The Kremlin’s sham referenda are a futile effort to mask what amounts to a further attempt at a land grab in Ukraine,” Blinken said in a statement.\n“This spectacle conducted by Russia’s proxies is illegitimate and violates international law. It is an affront to the principles of international peace and security,” he added.\nAl Jazeera’s correspondent James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters, said the UN Security Council would take action, with the US Representative to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield leading the work to present a resolution.\n“We are hearing a meeting has not been scheduled yet but [the resolution] is likely to be presented on Friday,” Bays said.\nAccording to a statement by Thomas-Greenfield on Tuesday, the resolution will be “condemning these sham referenda, calling on Member States not to recognise any altered status of Ukraine, and obligating Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.”\nMoscow-installed administrations in the four regions of southern and eastern Ukraine claimed late on Tuesday that voters had overwhelmingly backed joining Russia: 93 percent of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhia region supported annexation; as did 87 percent in the Kherson region; 98 percent in the Luhansk region; and 99 percent in Donetsk.\nRussia has said it will see Ukrainian attacks on annexed regions as attacks on itself and will use all means to defend it.\nRussian government officials have also warned that the four regions will fall under Moscow’s nuclear umbrella once they have been formally incorporated into Russia.\nThe Kremlin’s move for annexation comes as Ukrainian troops move to capture the Russian-held eastern town of Lyman, threatening a new setback for Putin’s campaign in the Donbas region, comprising Donetsk and Luhansk.\nThe capture of the town in the north of Donetsk region could pave the way for Ukraine to make inroads into the adjacent Luhansk province, foiling Putin’s goal of seizing all of the industrial Donbas region declared after his forces failed to take Kyiv.\n“The situation looks increasingly precarious for Russian forces in Lyman as Ukrainian forces are about to cut them off,” Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, said on Twitter on Thursday.\n“Another painful defeat for the Russian invasion forces is looming.”\nKyiv has so far held back from disclosing details of the situation in Lyman. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that a Ukrainian offensive on Lyman had failed, with 70 Ukrainian soldiers killed.\nPutin said on Thursday that “all mistakes” made in a call-up to reinforce Russian forces in Ukraine should be corrected, his first public acknowledgment that the “partial mobilisation” he announced last week had not gone smoothly.\nThere have been widespread public expressions of discontent from officials and citizens over the way the mobilisation has been handled, including complaints about enlistment officers sending call-up papers to clearly ineligible men.\nThe move has also triggered protests across Russia and led to hundreds of thousands of men fleeing the country.\n“In the course of this mobilisation, many questions are coming up, and all mistakes must be corrected and prevented from happening in the future,” Putin said.\n“For example, I’m thinking of fathers of many children, or people suffering from chronic diseases, or who those who are already past conscription age.”\nMeanwhile, Moscow is at loggerheads with Europe over leaks detected in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines from Russia to Germany, with still no firm indications as to what or who might have caused the damage.\nPutin spoke of “unprecedented sabotage” during a telephone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday, while top European Union officials threatened punishment for whoever was responsible but stopped short of attributing blame.\nRussia has requested an urgent debate on the matter at the UN Security Council in New York on Friday.",

Western governments and Kyiv have dismissed the hastily organised votes as breaching international law, and charge they were coercive and wholly unrepresentative.\nShortly after the ceremony, Russia vetoed a UN resolution that would have declared its referendums as having “no validity” and urged all countries not to recognise any “purported annexation” of the territory by Moscow.\nThe vote on the resolution in the 15-member Security Council was 10-1, with China, India, Brazil and Gabon abstaining.\nUS Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said before the vote that in the event of a Russian veto, the US and Albania – which sponsored the resolution – would take it to the 193-member General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, “and show that the world is still on the side of sovereignty and protecting territorial integrity”.\nEarlier on Friday, the Kremlin warned that Ukrainian attacks against any of the annexed regions would be considered aggression against Russia itself. In his speech, Putin said Russia would defend its new territory with all the means at its disposal.\nThe exact details of Russia’s annexation remain unclear but it appears that Russia is laying claim to about 109,000sq km (42,000sq miles) of Ukrainian territory, or about 18 percent, in addition to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\nIf Russia could establish control over the whole area it claims, Putin would have annexed about 136,000sq km (52,510sq miles) or more than 22 percent of Ukraine, whose borders Russia recognised in a treaty after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nThe United States and United Kingdom have announced new sanctions against Russia in response to the move, which US President Joe Biden said would hurt those who provided political or economic support to the annexation drive.\n“We will rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable. We will continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment it needs to defend itself, undeterred by Russia’s brazen effort to redraw the borders of its neighbour,” Biden said in a statement.\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg accused Putin of provoking “the most serious escalation” of the war since it began on February 24, but said he would not succeed in deterring the alliance from supporting Kyiv.\nIn Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was only ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president.\nHe also announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of NATO, something Moscow fiercely opposes, and accused Russia of redrawing borders “using murder, blackmail, mistreatment and lies”.\nHe said however that Kyiv remained committed to the idea of co-existence with Russia “on equal, honest, dignified and fair conditions”.\n“Clearly, with this Russian president, it is impossible. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia,” Zelenskyy said.\nOn Thursday, UN chief Antonio Guterres told reporters that “any decision to proceed with the annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions of Ukraine would have no legal value and deserves to be condemned”.\nHe called the annexation a “dangerous escalation”.\nMoscow has already taken a series of steps in what observers call efforts to “Russify” the annexed regions, a process that is most advanced in the occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, where it has handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to residents since 2019 and almost completely replaced Ukraine’s hryvnia currency with the Russian rouble.\nIn the occupied areas of all four regions, access to Ukrainian TV and mobile phone networks has been cut and only Russian channels and telecoms providers are available.\nSchools previously teaching the Ukrainian curriculum are being forced to adopt a new Russian one.\nMeanwhile, the pro-Russian separatist regions in Donetsk and Luhansk have their own flags, which will soon be replaced by Russia’s, while billboards on streets in Kherson and Zaporizhia hail their future as part of Russia.\nIn the speech, Putin urged Ukraine to cease military action and return to the negotiating table.\nThe Ukrainian government has pledged to recapture all the lands seized by Russia and said Moscow’s decision to annex the territories had destroyed any prospect of talks.\nPutin further decried the West’s backing of Ukraine in the conflict as an attempt to turn Russia into a “colony” and “crowds of slaves”.\n“After the collapse of the USSR, the West decided that the world would forever have to put up with its dictates,” Putin said on Friday, referring to the Soviet Union.\n“The West expected that Russia would not be able to cope with such dictates and fall apart … but Russia has been reborn and strengthened.”\nStill, Patrick Bury, a senior lecturer in security at the University of Bath in the UK, noted the speech – which seemed “more aimed at the global audience” – did not contain any specific ultimatum to Ukraine in terms of the region, nor did it contain any “mention of nuclear escalation”.\nThe omissions allay some concerns of a more immediate threat from Russia, he told Al Jazeera.\n“So the security implications now are: what does Ukraine do with these oblasts, do they continue attacking, and I imagine they will, in the short term?” he said. “And how does Russia respond?”",

                    "body": "Ukraine, Western countries and the United Nations have denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin’s move to proclaim the annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian provinces.\nDonetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia were formally declared part of Russia on Friday, in a major escalation in the war that began on February 24.\nMoscow claimed late on Tuesday that voters in the regions had overwhelmingly backed joining Russia after it run referendums over five days.\nKyiv and its Western allies had called these votes “a sham” and cautioned the Kremlin against moving forward with the annexation.\nBelow is a round-up of international reaction to Putin’s move.\nUkraine said its troops would continue liberating its territory occupied by Russia and that “nothing changes” after Putin’s annexation proclamation.\n“By attempting to annex Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Putin tries to grab territories he doesn’t even physically control on the ground,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n“Nothing changes for Ukraine: we continue liberating our land and our people, restoring our territorial integrity.”\nBy attempting to annex Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, Putin tries to grab territories he doesn’t even physically control on the ground. Nothing changes for Ukraine: we continue liberating our land and our people, restoring our territorial integrity.\n— Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) September 30, 2022\n\nGroup of Seven\nGroup of Seven (G7) foreign ministers said they would “never recognise” Russia’s annexation move, “nor the sham ‘referenda’ conducted at gunpoint”.\nPutin’s annexation efforts “constitute a new low point in Russia’s blatant flouting of international law”, the ministers said in a statement.\nThe G7 is an informal grouping of seven of the world’s advanced economies that includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n“The illegal annexation proclaimed by Putin won’t change anything. All territories illegally occupied by Russian invaders are Ukrainian land and will always be part of this sovereign nation,” Ursula von der Leyen said, adding that the commission was proposing “a new package of biting sanctions against Russia”.\nRussia has escalated the invasion of Ukraine to a new level.\nAnd we are determined to make the Kremlin pay the price for this further escalation.\nToday, we are proposing a new package of biting sanctions against Russia ↓ https://t.co/MrirRm1m4l\n— Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) September 28, 2022\n\n“We firmly reject and unequivocally condemn the illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions,” the members of the European Council said in a statement.\n“By wilfully undermining the rules-based international order and blatantly violating the fundamental rights of Ukraine to independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, core principles as enshrined in the UN Charter and international law, Russia is putting global security at risk,” the statement added.\nThe council said Russia had “engineered” the outcome of the vote held in the occupied provinces and had used its doctored results “as a pretext for this further violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\n“We will never recognise this illegal annexation,” it said.\nIn a message addressed to European citizens, European Council President Charles Michel said Putin’s move was “designed to intensify the nuclear threat against the rest of the world” and should be considered “an aggression against our fundamental freedoms and democratic principles”.\nThe US imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia targeting hundreds of people and companies, including those in Russia’s military-industrial complex and members of the legislature.\n“Make no mistake: these actions have no legitimacy. The United States will always honour Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders,” President Joe Biden said, adding that his country would “rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable”.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said on Twitter the US had taken “swift and severe measures in response to President Putin’s attempt to annex regions of Ukraine – a clear violation of international law”.\n“We will continue to impose costs on anyone that provides political or economic support for this sham,” he said.\nJens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, said Russia’s recent actions constituted the most serious escalation of the seven-month war.\n“Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory. Together, this represents the most serious escalation since the start of the war,” Stoltenberg told reporters.\nHe said NATO reaffirmed its “unwavering support” for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and would not be deterred from supporting the country in defending itself against Russia.\nThe Polish foreign ministry also condemned the signature of the annexation treaties as it called for an increase in military support for Kyiv and more sanctions.\n“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemns in the strongest terms the illegal acts of ‘recognition of independence’ and ‘incorporation’ into the Russian Federation of parts of Ukraine’s regions of Kherson, Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia,” it said in a statement.\n“The Netherlands will never recognise this annexation, just as we don’t recognise the annexation of Crimea,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, referring to Russia’s seizure of the peninsula in 2014.\n“Putin cannot be allowed to alter international borders using brute force. We will ensure he loses this illegal war,” British Prime Minister Liz Truss said in a statement.\n“Putin has, once again, acted in violation of international law with clear disregard for the lives of the Ukrainian people he claims to represent,” she said, adding the UK would never accept the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia as “anything other than Ukrainian territory”.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron condemned Russia’s annexation saying the move represented “a serious violation of both international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty.”\n“France is opposed to this and stands by Ukraine’s side as it faces Russia’s aggression and recovers full sovereignty on the entirety of its territory,” the Élysée said.\n“The decision is illegal as it violates blatantly international law and it is void,” the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.\nPutin “once again demonstrates his Soviet-style, neo-imperialist vision that threatens the security of the entire European continent,” said Italian far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, whose party came first in the country’s election last week.\n“The declaration of annexation to the Russian Federation of four Ukrainian regions following sham referendums held under violent military occupation has no legal or political value,” Meloni said in a statement.\n“This further violation by Russia of the rules of coexistence between nations confirms the need for unity by Western democracies,” she added.\nHer comment reflected a statement by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi which said Italy would “never recognise” the annexation.\n“It’s nothing but a complete farce,” Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said.\n“We condemn the illegal annexation in the strongest terms.”\nSpeaking at a news conference before Putin’s annexation announcement on Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned that formal annexation would further jeopardise the prospects for peace.\n“It is time to step back from the brink” and “end this devastating and senseless war”, he said, noting that annexation would have “no legal value”.",

                    "body": "Russian-installed officials in occupied regions of Ukraine have reported huge majorities in favour of becoming part of Russia after five days of voting in “referendums” that Kyiv and its allies have condemned as illegitimate and a sham.\nHastily arranged votes took place in four areas – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – that make up about 15 percent of Ukrainian territory.\nLuhansk authorities said 98.4 percent of people there had voted to join Russia. In Zaporizhia, a Russian-appointed official put the figure at 93.1 percent. In Kherson, the head of the voting committee said the “yes” vote was above 87 percent.\nDenis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said 99.2 percent of participants in the region had voted to join Russia. In all four areas, officials said all the ballots had been counted.\nWithin the occupied territories, ballot boxes were reportedly taken from house to house in what Ukraine and its allies have called an illegitimate, coercive exercise to create a legal pretext for Russia to annex the four regions.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin could then portray any Ukrainian attempt to recapture its territory as an attack on Russia itself. He said last week he was willing to use nuclear weapons to defend the “territorial integrity” of Russia.\nAs voting concluded, the United Nations Security Council held an open session on the referendums in New York City.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to the body in a virtual address shortly after word came that residents in the Zaporizhia region had reportedly voted to join Russia.\n“In front of the eyes of the whole world Russia is conducting this so-called sham referendum on the occupied territory of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “People are forced to fill out some papers while being threatened by submachine guns.”\nPeople who had left the four regions for Russia were also able to vote and state news agency RIA said early counts showed numbers in excess of 96 percent in favour of the Ukrainian territory coming under Moscow’s rule.\nPutin ally Dmitry Medvedev, a former president who is now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, posted a brief celebratory message on Telegram. “The referendums are over,” he said. “The results are clear. Welcome home, to Russia!”\nUkraine has repeatedly warned that the Russian annexation of its regions would destroy any chance of peace talks with Moscow, which began its invasion seven months ago.\n“There is nothing to talk about with [the] current Russian president,” Zelenskyy said.\nThe votes were hastily arranged within a few days after Ukraine routed Russian forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region, and made gains in the south as a September counteroffensive gathered momentum.\nKyiv’s allies reiterated their condemnation of the referendums, with Canada saying it would impose new sanctions.\n“Canada does not – and will not ever – recognize the results of Russia’s illegitimate referendums or its attempted, illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement on Wednesday that was shared on social media.\n“Let me be clear: Ukraine’s borders will not change. Ukraine’s territory will remain Ukraine’s.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Kryvyi Rih just west of Zaporizhia, said most people she spoke to said they already “know the results of the referendum, without waiting the full five days of voting. Other people are worried about what happens after the referendum.\n“We saw over the past five days, civilians trying to get out of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kherson, and they’ve been saying all along the same thing – some would tell you that this referendum for them was the last [straw].\n“They said that, lately, it had become much more strict and much harder to live, but there is that fear of mobilisation [into the Russian forces],” Abdel-Hamid said.\nThe votes follow a similar referendum conducted in Crimea after Russia seized the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 when Moscow-backed leaders declared a 97 percent vote to join Russia. The annexation has never been recognised by the international community.\nSpeaking on state TV on Tuesday, Putin said the votes were to protect ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people from alleged persecution. Kyiv has denied any such discrimination.\nMoscow has acted in recent months to “Russify” areas under its control, including by issuing people with Russian passports and rewriting school curriculums.\nValentina Matviyenko, head of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said that if the vote results were favourable, Russia could consider annexing the four regions on October 4, three days before Putin celebrates his 70th birthday.\nAt the UN, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council meeting that the body “remains fully committed” to Ukraine’s territorial integrity “within its internationally recognised borders”.\nWhile Moscow’s veto means there is no chance the Security Council will reach a consensus on Russia’s annexation, the United States intends to submit a resolution urging member states “not to recognize any altered status of Ukraine and obligating Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine,” said US envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\nChina, Moscow’s closest major ally since the Ukraine invasion, has yet to overtly condemn the offensive, but it told the Security Council that the “territorial integrity of all countries should be respected”.\nAs Russia began releasing the results of the referendums, Medvedev issued a blunt new nuclear warning.\n“I want to remind you – the deaf who hear only themselves: Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons if necessary,” he said on social media.\nPentagon Spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said the US was taking the reiterated threat “seriously” but had seen nothing to cause Washington to change its nuclear posture.\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said: “Russia must know that the nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”",

There are territorial disputes for which at the moment there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution. That’s a difficult hurdle for Ukraine to jump over. But maybe allowances will be given.”\nRussia’s president Vladimir Putin has signed treaties to formally annex four regions of Ukraine, recognising them as Russian territory. \nIn a speech railing against the West and the global order, he called on Ukraine to come to the negotiating table ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/CTzrhb6KIz\n— Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) September 30, 2022\n\nDuring Russia’s seven-month war in the neighbouring country, Ukraine has shifted off Soviet-era weapon systems and has been using NATO-standard ordinance and weapons, though the process is still continuing.\nUkraine, Western countries and the United Nations secretary-general have denounced Putin’s move to annex the Ukrainian regions, which represents a major escalation in the war that began with Russia’s invasion on February 24.\nNATO accused Putin of provoking “the most serious escalation” of the war in Ukraine since it began, but said he would not succeed in deterring the alliance from supporting Kyiv.\n“We have the combination of the mobilisation in Russia, combined with the reckless, dangerous nuclear rhetoric, and then today’s illegal annexation, or attempt to annex parts of Ukraine,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.\n“Together this is the most serious escalation of the conflict since the start and the aim of President Putin is to deter us from supporting Ukraine. But he will not succeed in that,” he told a news conference.\nStoltenberg remained non-committal on Ukraine’s NATO accession bid.\n“Our focus now is on providing immediate support to Ukraine to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian brutal invasion,” he said.\nUS President Joe Biden called the annexation a “violation of international law” and said that Putin’s actions have no legitimacy. The US said it would continue to acknowledge the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine. Washington also announced a new round of sanctions against Moscow.\nAt a ceremony on Friday, Putin said Russia has “four new regions”, calling the residents of Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions “our citizens forever”.\n“This is the will of millions of people,” he said in the speech before hundreds of dignitaries at the St George’s Hall of the Kremlin.\nIn his speech, Putin sent out several messages to various target audiences, said Al Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall, who is reporting from Moscow.\n“One [was] to the Russians, that this is for their interest, that this is to make Russia strong again, this is for the protection of the Russian great civilisation and great history and values, and it is for the future generations to protect Russia from the ‘bad influence’ coming from the West,” Vall said.\n“The other message is addressed to the West itself, that they have to know that their plans to ‘destroy Russia’ will never succeed and that Russia will never accept to be under their tutelage.”\nAnd the final message was for Ukraine, “to forget about the territories that have been annexed, to come to the negotiations table, probably to accept the new border that Russia has drawn”, he said.\nZelenskyy said on Friday he was still prepared to hold talks with Russia, but not as long as Putin remained president.",

                    "body": "Russia’s attempt to annex southern and eastern Ukrainian territory signals the Kremlin’s commitment to the offensive, according to some Russian political insiders.\n“There is no doubt that Russia has crossed the Rubicon,” said Konstantin Zatulin, a senior lawmaker in the State Duma from the ruling United Russia party.\nZatulin told Al Jazeera that the recent annexation referendums are meant to show the West that Russia has no intention of backing down from its political and military objectives in Ukraine despite recent setbacks.\n“In the face of external pressure, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin usually raises the stakes instead of taking a step back or offering concessions,” he said.\n“Such a move closes off some options for retreat, but we’re talking about Russia’s fight to secure its existence and place in the world against efforts to divide and inflict irreparable damage against us.”\nPro-Russian authorities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia claimed on Wednesday that residents had voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining Russia, in hastily-organised annexation referendums widely condemned by Kyiv and its Western partners as illegal.\nRussia had already recognised Donetsk and Luhansk as independent “people’s republics” back in February, setting the stage for its invasion of Ukraine days later.\nMoscow had thrown its support behind the rebel-held statelets in 2014, the year it annexed Crimea from Ukraine – a move that also followed an unrecognised referendum.\nKherson and a large part of Zaporizhia, meanwhile, were captured by Russian forces during the early stages of this year’s conflict.\nThe referendums took place under military occupation and without any outside oversight, and are viewed by much of the international community as meaningless.\nEven Russia’s closest allies – China, India, Kazakhstan, and Serbia – have indicated that they will not recognise the results of the vote or any attempts at annexation.\nNonetheless, Putin will formally announce Russia’s plans to incorporate the four regions during a speech before Russian lawmakers on Friday.\nFrom there, both houses of parliament will be tasked with voting on the resolution at a plenary session next week.\nAlthough there had been discussions about incorporating Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia into Russia for months, the referendums were announced and held in the space of two weeks.\nAndranik Migranyan, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and former adviser to the presidential administration, said Russia decided it needed to take “serious and decisive steps to regain the initiative” following a surprise Ukrainian counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region earlier this month.\nThe votes and Moscow’s recent decision to mobilise more troops are signs of Russia’s determination, Migranyan argued.\n“I think Putin’s decision was meant to dramatically change the situation and put both the West and Ukraine in a very uncomfortable position,” he said.\n“These referendums close the door to any negotiations and open the possibility to the total liquidation of Ukraine as an independent state because any territory that Russia gains in the future could be integrated into Russia.”\nMigranyan explained that Russia wants to see the West stop arming Ukraine and instead pressure Kyiv to accept Moscow’s terms for ending the conflict.\n“Otherwise, Ukraine will cease to exist, which will be a massive defeat for the West – especially for [US President Joe] Biden and the Democrats on the eve of the midterm elections,” he said.\nBefore the Russian invasion, Moscow had insisted on guarantees that Ukraine would never join NATO. However, since the war began, its terms appear less clear.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told CBS News earlier this week that it would become “impossible to continue any diplomatic negotiations” with Russia after it goes ahead with its annexation plan.\nFor its part, the Kremlin has warned that following the referendums, “the legal situation will radically change from the point of view of international law and that will also have consequences for security in these territories”.\nDuring a national televised address last week, Putin said Russia was prepared to use “all the means at our disposal”, including nuclear weapons, to counter potential threats to its territorial integrity.\nSubsequent statements by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and former President Dmitry Medvedev, a close Putin ally, appeared to indicate that this pledge extended to the territories that Russia formally seize from Ukraine.\nBut two retired Russian generals told Al Jazeera last week that Russia is unlikely to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine unless NATO troops become directly involved in the conflict.\nZatulin likewise dismissed the prospect of Russia conducting a nuclear strike against Ukraine as “nonsense” and contended that previous statements by Moscow had been taken out of context in the West.\n“Russia made these statements so that the West understood that it is prepared to use any means if the country’s very existence will be under threat,” he said. “But it is the fate of Ukraine, not Russia, that is at stake right now.”\nZatulin did suggest that Moscow would seek to ramp up its conventional military effort, however.\nHe predicted that the battle for Ukraine would reach a “crescendo” in November or December, around the time Russia’s forces are expected to begin receiving significant reinforcements from mobilised reservists.\n“Some Western analysts have argued that Russia stands to benefit from a prolonged war of attrition,” he said. “I don’t agree with this assessment at all. The quicker Russia can achieve something that can be considered a significant victory, the better.”",

                    "body": "Russia has used its veto at the United Nations Security Council to scuttle a draft resolution that sought to condemn its annexations of Ukrainian territory.\nBut even Moscow’s close friends China and India chose to abstain rather than vote against the resolution that condemned the Kremlin’s latest actions in Ukraine.\nUnited States ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield introduced the resolution to the Security Council meeting on Friday that called on member states not to recognise any altered status of Ukraine and obliged Russia to withdraw its troops.\nEarlier, the biggest annexation in Europe since World War II was undertaken when Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russian rule over four regions that make up 15 percent of Ukraine’s territory.\nThe resolution, co-sponsored by the US and Albania, called for the condemnation of the “illegal” referendums held in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine and for all states to not recognise any changes to Ukraine’s borders.\nThe resolution also called on Russia to withdraw troops immediately from Ukraine, ending an invasion that was launched on February 24.\nTen nations voted in favour of the resolution, while China, Gabon, India and Brazil abstained.\n“Not a single country voted with Russia. Not one,” Thomas-Greenfield told reporters after the meeting, adding that the abstentions “clearly were not a defence of Russia”.\nRussian ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia, who raised his hand to indicate the only vote against the resolution, argued the regions, where Moscow has seized territory by force and where fighting still rages, chose to be part of Russia.\n“There will be no turning back as today’s draft resolution would try to impose,” Nebenzia told the meeting.\nUkrainian ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya said the single hand raised against the resolution “again testified to Russia’s isolation and his desperate attempts to deny reality in our common commitments, starting from the UN charter”.\nThe United Kingdom’s envoy, Barbara Woodward, said Russia had “abused its veto to defend its illegal actions” but said the annexations had “no legal effect”.\n“It is a fantasy,” she added.\nAl Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from the United Nations in New York, said in response to the resolution the Russian representative “sounded incredulous”, and it was no surprise that Russia then used its power as a permanent member of the Security Council to veto the resolution.\n“But it’s notable that four other council members decided not to support the resolution, and instead to abstain – China, Brazil, Gabon and India,” Bays said.\n“Right after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when the UN General Assembly voted at the beginning of March, 141 countries voted to deplore Russia’s actions. Following the Security Council vote, and the abstentions, some will be asking whether it’s possible to reach the high water mark again,” he said.\nThe UK's UN ambassador spoke to @AJEnglish after Russia's veto in the UN Security Council of a draft resolution condemning annexation votes held in parts of occupied Ukraine.@UKUN_NewYork's @BWoodward_UN told @baysontheroad the issue will go to the General Assembly next week. pic.twitter.com/rLgfYcrVhs\n— Amanda Price (@amandaruthprice) September 30, 2022\n\nChina abstained from voting on the resolution, but also raised concerns about “a prolonged and expanded crisis” in Ukraine.\nChina has been firmly on the fence over the conflict in Ukraine, criticizing Western sanctions against Russia but stopping short of endorsing or assisting in Moscow’s military campaign, despite the two nations declaring a “no-limits” strategic partnership in February.\nIn a surprise acknowledgement, Putin recently said China’s leader Xi Jinping had concerns about Ukraine.\nBeijing’s UN ambassador Zhang Jun argued that while “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be safeguarded”, countries’ “legitimate security concerns” should also be taken seriously.\n“Over seven months into the Ukraine crisis, the crisis and its spillover effects have had a wide range of negative impacts. The prospect of a prolonged and expanded crisis is also worrying. China is deeply concerned about this prospect,” the ambassador said in a statement.\nExplanation of Vote by Ambassador Zhang Jun on the UN Security Council Draft Resolution on Ukrainehttps://t.co/o8HzQL0zf9 pic.twitter.com/xUm2bcsx5e\n— Chinese Mission to UN (@Chinamission2un) October 1, 2022\n\nA US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China’s abstention from the vote showed that Russia’s “sabre rattling” and moves that threatened other states’ territorial integrity put China in an “uncomfortable position”.\n“We don’t have China signing up for this much more aggressive agenda that Russia is trying to sell,” the official said.",
